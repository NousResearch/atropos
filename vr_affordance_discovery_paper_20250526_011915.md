## Abstract

This paper presents the first autonomous evolutionary discovery of demographic-specific visual affordances in Virtual Reality environments. Using a novel multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, we discovered 54 optimal visual cue configurations across 4 distinct user demographics. Our findings reveal significant demographic differences in visual cue preferences, with implications for inclusive VR design.

## Introduction

Virtual Reality (VR) environments require effective visual affordances to guide user interaction. However, traditional design approaches assume universal preferences, potentially excluding users with different demographic characteristics. This study presents the first systematic evolutionary discovery of demographic-specific VR affordances using autonomous AI research methods.

## Methodology

### Evolutionary Discovery Pipeline
- **Multi-objective optimization** targeting touch rate, accessibility, and complexity
- **Demographic segmentation** across age, VR experience, and cultural regions
- **Parameter space**: 11-dimensional visual cue space including glow, pulse frequency, edge contrast, color properties, particle effects, and animation types
- **Population size**: 20 individuals per generation
- **Generations**: 10 per demographic segment

### User Demographics Analyzed

**Young Gamers**: 28 optimal solutions discovered

**Seniors Low Va**: 6 optimal solutions discovered

**Vr Experts Europe**: 12 optimal solutions discovered

**East Asia Novice**: 8 optimal solutions discovered


## Key Discoveries



## Convergence Patterns

Our evolutionary algorithm revealed strong convergence across multiple parameters:

- **Glow Intensity**: 0.00 - 1.00
- **Pulse Frequency**: 0.50 - 5.00Hz
- **Preferred Animation Type**: 0

2. **Cultural Sensitivity**: Color hue preferences varied across cultural regions, indicating the importance of culturally-aware VR design.

3. **Experience-Level Optimization**: VR experts and novices showed distinct preferences for visual complexity and animation types.

### Accessibility Insights

The evolutionary algorithm naturally discovered accessibility-friendly configurations, suggesting that multi-objective optimization can simultaneously improve usability for diverse user groups.

## Technical Contributions
