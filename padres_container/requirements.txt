# fastapi and uvicorn are in app/requirements.txt for the app layer
# spatial_env.py also uses:
wandb # for process_mode and general logging
anthropic # for llm_services if used directly by spatial_env or its demo runner
# We are aiming for the service API to not directly make LLM calls,
# so anthropic might not be strictly needed here if that refactoring is complete.
# For now, include fastapi & uvicorn for the API service.
