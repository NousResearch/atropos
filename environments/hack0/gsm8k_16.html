</code></pre>
<p><reasoning><br />
To compute the probability of winning this game, we need to analyze the chance that no card will match the current counter during the entire deck dealing process.</p>
<p>Important observations:<br />
- The deck has 52 cards, with each rank (1 through 13) appearing exactly 4 times.<br />
- The dealing order is uniformly random (the deck is shuffled).<br />
- The counter cycles between 1 and 2 as we proceed through cards; it alternates: for card 1, it becomes 1; for card 2, it becomes 2; and so forth.<br />
- The game starts with a counter at 0, then after dealing each card, the counter is updated as <code>count = (count % 2) + 1</code>, so the cycle is 1, 2, 1, 2,... with the first card dealt at counter=1.<br />
- The player loses if the current counter matches the rank of the dealt card at that position.</p>
<p>Given the counter alternates between 1 and 2, only cards with rank 1 or 2 can cause a loss, as a match occurs only when <code>counter == card rank</code>.</p>
<p>Thus, for each card, the probability it causes a loss depends on if the card's rank equals the current counter:<br />
- For cards where the counter is 1, a loss occurs if the card rank is 1.<br />
- For cards where the counter is 2, a loss occurs if the card rank is 2.</p>
<p>Since the counter alternates:<br />
- The first card dealt has counter=1.<br />
- The second card has counter=2.<br />
- The third card has counter=1.<br />
- And so on...</p>
<p>Number of positions:<br />
- For 26 odd positions (1,3,5,...,51), the counter=1.<br />
- For 26 even positions (2,4,6,...,52), the counter=2.</p>
<p>Number of cards with rank=1:<br />
- 4 instances.</p>
<p>Number of cards with rank=2:<br />
- 4 instances.</p>
<p>Our goal:<br />
Calculate the probability that none of these 4 rank=1 cards appear in positions with counter=1, and none of the 4 rank=2 cards appear in positions with counter=2.</p>
<p>Calculating the probability:<br />
- Total arrangements: all permutations of the deck (52!).<br />
- For the 'loss' conditions not to occur:<br />
    - The 4 rank=1 cards must be in the 26 positions where counter=2 (even positions).<br />
    - The 4 rank=2 cards must be in the 26 positions where counter=1 (odd positions).</p>
<p>Number of favorable arrangements:<br />
- Choose 4 positions among the 26 even positions for the rank=1 cards: C(26,4).<br />
- Place the 4 rank=1 cards in these positions (permutations: 4!).<br />
- Choose 4 positions among the 26 odd positions for the rank=2 cards: C(26,4).<br />
- Place the 4 rank=2 cards in these positions (permutations: 4!).<br />
- The remaining positions (non-specific) are filled with the remaining 44 cards (since 4 rank=1 and 4 rank=2 are placed), which can be arranged in 44! ways.</p>
<p>Total arrangements:<br />
- The total of all possible permutations of the deck is 52!.</p>
<p>Therefore, the probability of winning is:<br />
[ \frac{\text{Number of favorable arrangements}}{\text{Total arrangements}} = \frac{\binom{26}{4} \times 4! \times \binom{26}{4} \times 4! \times 44!}{52!} ]</p>
<p>We can write this as a simplified expression:<br />
[ \boxed{ \frac{\left[ C(26,4) \times 4! \right]^2 \times 44! }{52!} } ]<br />
which corresponds to the count of arrangements avoiding placing the rank=1 cards in odd positions and rank=2 cards in even positions.</p>

\frac{\left( C(26,4) \times 4! \right)^2 \times 44!}{52!}<br />

</code></pre>
<p><reasoning><br />
Initially, we recognize that the game involves a deck of 52 cards, with each rank from 1 to 13 appearing exactly 4 times, totaling 52 cards. The deck is randomly shuffled. The dealing process involves a counter that alternates between 1 and 2 (i.e., cycles as 1, 2, 1, 2,...), and at each deal, if the counter matches the card's value, the player immediately loses. The player wins only if no such matches occur throughout the entire deal.</p>
<p>The core challenge is to compute the probability that, for all cards in the deck, the counter does not match the card's value.</p>
<p>Important observations:<br />
- The counter alternates between 1 and 2, meaning only cards with value 1 or 2 can cause a loss.<br />
- For each card, the probability that it is of value 1 is 4/52, and similarly for value 2 is 4/52.<br />
- When encountering a card with value 1, the counter is 1; when encountering a card with value 2, the counter is 2.<br />
- For all other card values (3-13), any counter value (1 or 2) does not cause a loss.</p>
<p>Additionally, the game is played sequentially, and the loss condition's dependence on the sequence complicates the calculation but can be broken down:</p>
<ol>
<li>Determine the positions of the 4 cards with value 1 in the deck.</li>
<li>Determine the positions of the 4 cards with value 2 in the deck.</li>
<li>For the game to be won:</li>
<li>None of the positions occupied by value 1 cards can coincide with a counter value of 1 at that position.</li>
<li>None of the positions occupied by value 2 cards can coincide with a counter value of 2 at that position.</li>
<li>Filter sequences where, at each position, the card's value does not cause a match with the counter.</li>
</ol>
<p>Since the counter alternates every card, positions where the counter is 1 are the odd positions (1, 3, 5,...) and positions where it is 2 are the even positions (2, 4, 6,...).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For the 8 special cards (4 with value 1 and 4 with value 2):</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 4 cards with value 1 must all be placed in positions with counter == 1 (the odd positions).</p>
</li>
<li>The 4 cards with value 2 must all be in positions with counter == 2 (the even positions).</li>
</ul>
<p>Total positions: 52.</p>
<p>Number of odd positions: 26<br />
Number of even positions: 26</p>
<p>Probability calculation involves counting the arrangements where:<br />
- The 4 value-1 cards occupy any 4 of the 26 odd positions.<br />
- The 4 value-2 cards occupy any 4 of the 26 even positions.<br />
- The remaining 44 cards (values 3-13) can be placed in any remaining positions freely.</p>
<p>The total number of arrangements (without restrictions) is:<br />
Total arrangements (permutations of deck with fixed sets):<br />
[ \text{Total} = \frac{52!}{(4!)^{13}} ]<br />
but since we are considering uniform randomly shuffled deck conditions, we consider choices of positions rather than the permutations directly.</p>
<p>Number of favorable arrangements:<br />
[ \binom{26}{4} \times \binom{26}{4} \times (40! \text{ arrangements for remaining 40 cards}) ]</p>
<p>Probability:<br />
[ P(\text{win}) = \frac{\binom{26}{4} \times \binom{26}{4} \times 40! \times 4!^{13 - 2}}{\text{Total arrangements}} ]</p>
<p>But more simply, for the given positions:<br />
- The positions of value-1 cards in the odd positions:<br />
[ \binom{26}{4} ]<br />
- The positions of value-2 cards in the even positions:<br />
[ \binom{26}{4} ]</p>
<p>and the remaining cards can be arranged in any remaining positions.</p>
<p>To get the exact probability, the key step is to compute the ratio of favorable arrangements over total arrangements, which simplifies to the product of these binomial coefficients (since all arrangements are equally likely):</p>
<p>[<br />
\text{Probability} = \frac{\binom{26}{4} \times \binom{26}{4}}{\binom{52}{4} \times \binom{48}{4}}<br />
]</p>
<p>since choosing positions for value-1 and value-2 cards independently among the relevant halves, and the remaining 44 cards fill the remaining positions uniformly at random (which does not affect the probability of the match).</p>
<p>Therefore, the probability that all value-1 cards are placed on positions with counter=1 (odd positions), and all value-2 cards are on positions with counter=2 (even positions), is:</p>
<p>[<br />
\boxed{<br />
\frac{\binom{26}{4} \times \binom{26}{4}}{\binom{52}{4} \times \binom{48}{4}}<br />

<p><reasoning><br />
To determine the probability of winning this game, I need to analyze the process step by step. The game involves a deck of 52 cards, with each rank (1-13) appearing 4 times, shuffled randomly. The game proceeds card by card, maintaining a counter that alternates between 1 and 2. At each step, if the counter matches the card value, the game is lost; otherwise, it continues until all 52 cards are dealt, resulting in a win.</p>
<p>Important observations:<br />
- The counter alternates between 1 and 2 deterministically.<br />
- For each card, the probability that the counter matches the card value depends on the position's counter.<br />
- Since the counter alternates every card, the entire deck's positions are split into two groups:<br />
  - Odd positions: counter = 1<br />
  - Even positions: counter = 2<br />
- The probability of winning depends on whether, at each position, the card's value is different from the counter assigned at that position.</p>
<p>Under the assumption of uniform randomness:<br />
- Each card value is equally likely to appear at any position.<br />
- The card's values are independent of position, which allows us to treat each position separately.</p>
<p>Mathematically:<br />
- For positions where the counter = 1 (odd positions):<br />
  - The game is lost if the card value is 1.<br />
- For positions where the counter = 2 (even positions):<br />
  - The game is lost if the card value is 2.</p>
<p>Since all cards are equally likely and shuffled uniformly:<br />
- The probability that at a specific position, the card's value causes a loss is the likelihood that the card's value matches the counter's current value:<br />
  - At odd positions: P(Card = 1)<br />
  - At even positions: P(Card = 2)</p>
<p>For each position, the probability that the card's value is equal to the counter value:<br />
- (\frac{4}{52}) (since each value appears 4 times out of 52 cards)</p>
<p>To find the probability of winning:<br />
- For every position, the event "no match" must occur:<br />
  - ( P(\text{no match at a position}) = 1 - \text{Probability that the card value matches the counter} )</p>
<p>Positions:<br />
- Odd positions: match occurs if card = 1<br />
- Even positions: match occurs if card = 2</p>
<p>Because the deck is shuffled randomly:<br />
- The probability that the card at any position is exactly the one that causes a match is (\frac{4}{52} = \frac{1}{13}).</p>
<p>Considering independence (which holds under uniform random shuffling):<br />
- The total probability of winning is the product over all positions that no match occurs:<br />
[<br />
P(\text{win}) = \prod_{i=1}^{52} \left( 1 - \frac{\text{probability card causes a match at position } i} \right)<br />
]<br />
which simplifies to:<br />
[<br />
P(\text{win}) = \left(1 - \frac{4}{52}\right)^{52}<br />
]<br />
since at each position, the probability of causing a match is (\frac{4}{52}), regardless of position.</p>
<p>Therefore, the exact probability of winning is:<br />
[<br />
\boxed{\left(1 - \frac{4}{52}\right)^{52}}<br />
]</p>

\left(1 - \frac{4}{52}\right)^{52}<br />

<p><reasoning><br />
Initial Approach: To compute the exact probability of winning, I will analyze the game step-by-step, considering the uniform randomness of the deck and the deterministic cyclic counter. Since the deck is uniformly shuffled, each card's position and value are equally likely, and each card's likelihood of causing a loss depends on whether its value matches the current counter value at its turn.</p>
<p>Observations about the game mechanics:<br />
- The deck contains 52 cards, with each rank (1–13) appearing exactly 4 times.<br />
- The counter alternates between 1 and 2, starting at 1, then 2, then 1, etc., cycling every card.<br />
- The counter's sequence:<br />
  - For the 1st card: count = 1<br />
  - 2nd card: count = 2<br />
  - 3rd card: count = 1<br />
  - 4th card: count = 2<br />
  - and so on, alternating each turn.<br />
- The game is lost immediately if, at any turn, the current card's value equals the counter at that turn.<br />
- The game is won if, after all 52 cards are dealt, no such match occurs.</p>
<p>Step-by-step derivation:<br />
1. Because the deck is shuffled uniformly at random, each position is equally likely to contain any particular card value.<br />
2. The total number of cards with value v (where v ∈ {1,...,13}) is 4.<br />
3. The total possible arrangements of the deck: 52! (though we don't need the exact arrangements, just probabilities).<br />
4. For each card position i (from 1 to 52):<br />
    - The counter value c(i) is 1 if i is odd, 2 if i is even.<br />
    - The probability that a specific card with value v appears at position i is uniform among remaining cards at that step.</p>
<p>We are interested in the probability that none of the cards with value v appear at positions where c(i) equals v. Conversely, the probability that no match occurs is the probability that, for each value v, the four cards of value v are never assigned to positions i where c(i) = v.</p>
<p>Since the positions are fixed (alternating between 1 and 2), the game reduces to:<br />
- For each v, the four cards with value v must avoid all positions i where c(i) = v.</p>
<p>Because the positions are deterministic (fixed sequence of counter values):<br />
- For v = 1, the "losing" positions are all odd positions i where c(i) = 1.<br />
- For v = 2, the losing positions are all even positions i where c(i) = 2.</p>
<p>No other values v &gt; 2 are involved in matching the counter, because only counter values 1 and 2 exist, but our rules specify losing if the counter matches the card value. Wait, the card values v are 1-13, but the counter only takes values 1 and 2, so only cards with value 1 and 2 can cause an immediate loss by matching the counter.</p>
<p>Hence:<br />
- Only cards with value 1 or 2 can cause a match, because the counter is only 1 or 2 at any time.<br />
- Cards with value 3–13 cannot match the counter's value and thus do not lead to immediate loss.</p>
<p>Therefore, the problem simplifies to:<br />
- Placing the four "1" cards in positions where c(i) = 1 (i.e., odd positions).<br />
- Placing the four "2" cards in positions where c(i) = 2 (even positions).</p>
<p>The total number of positions:<br />
- Positions where c(i) = 1: all odd positions = 1, 3, 5,..., 51 → total 26 positions.<br />
- Positions where c(i) = 2: all even positions = 2, 4, 6,..., 52 → total 26 positions.</p>
<p>Now, the initial total number of arrangements of the deck:<br />
- Place the 4 "1" cards in the 26 positions where c(i) = 1, and the 4 "2" cards in the 26 positions where c(i) = 2.<br />
- The remaining 44 positions are filled with the other 44 cards (values 3–13, four copies each), which can be arranged arbitrarily.</p>
<p>The key constraint for winning:<br />
- The 4 "1" cards must occupy any 4 of the 26 "counter=1" positions, avoiding positions where c(i)=2.<br />
- The 4 "2" cards must occupy any 4 of the 26 "counter=2" positions, avoiding positions where c(i)=1.<br />
- Since the "1" cards are only placed in positions with counter=1 and "2" cards only in positions with counter=2 (which separates them), no conflicts occur if placed correctly.</p>
<p>Total favorable arrangements:<br />
- Number of ways to assign 4 "1" cards to 26 "counter=1" positions: C(26,4)<br />
- Number of ways to assign 4 "2" cards to 26 "counter=2" positions: C(26,4)<br />
- The remaining cards (44 cards for ranks 3–13) can be placed freely, with arrangements of the other cards not affecting the win condition.</p>
<p>Since the other 44 cards are independent of the "1" and "2" cards in terms of conditions, the probability that all "1" and "2" cards avoid the "matching" positions (i.e., that none of the four "1"s are in a position where c(i)=1 and similarly for "2"s) is:</p>
<p>Number of successful arrangements over total arrangements of all 52 cards:<br />
= [C(26,4) * C(26,4)] / C(52,4) * (number of arrangements of the remaining 44 cards).</p>
<p>But to get the probability, because the deck is uniformly shuffled:<br />
- The probability that the four "1" cards are exactly in any 4 of the 26 "counter=1" positions is C(26,4) / C(52,4).<br />
- Similarly for "2" cards: C(26,4) / C(52,4).</p>
<p>Overall probability:<br />
= [C(26,4) / C(52,4)] * [C(26,4) / C(52,4)] = (C(26,4))^2 / (C(52,4))^2</p>
<p>Because other cards do not influence the matching condition, the total probability of winning is this ratio.</p>
<p><formula><br />
( C(26,4) * C(26,4) ) / C(52,4)<br />
</formula></p>
<p>(Note: Since the question asks for the probability of winning rather than raw arrangements, and the calculations involve choosing the positions of the "1" and "2" cards carefully, the ratio simplifies to the product of combinations over total combinations, which directly gives the probability.)</p>

<p><reasoning><br />
Initial approach: To determine the probability of winning, i.e., going through all 52 cards without any counter-value match, we need to analyze the interplay between the deck composition, the cycling counter, and the matching condition.</p>
<p>Important observations:<br />
- The deck contains 4 copies of each rank from 1 to 13.<br />
- The counter cycles between 1 and 2 repeatedly: that is, it toggles between 1 and 2 at each card dealt.<br />
- The position of each card determines which counter value it encounters:<br />
  - If the first card is dealt at position 1, counter=1.<br />
  - If the second card is at position 2, counter=2.<br />
  - At position n, the counter = 1 if n is odd, = 2 if n is even.<br />
- The matching condition: loss occurs if deck card's value equals the counter.</p>
<p>Mathematically:<br />
- The game ends (loss) if any card with value 1 is in an odd position.<br />
- The game ends (loss) if any card with value 2 is in an even position.<br />
- For all other card values (3 to 13), there's no restriction: the game does not end because of these cards.</p>
<p>Thus:<br />
- The only possible loss arises from placing a '1' in an odd position.<br />
- Or placing a '2' in an even position.</p>
<p>To find the probability of winning:<br />
- The total number of arrangements of the deck (assuming a perfect shuffle) is:<br />
  total = factorial(52) / (factorial(4)^13)<br />
  But since the game is symmetric and we are interested in probabilities, we can treat all arrangements equally.</p>
<ul>
<li>For a 'lucky' arrangement (winning), none of the '1's are in odd positions, and none of the '2's are in even positions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Partition positions:<br />
- Odd positions: 1,3,5,...,51 (total 26)<br />
- Even positions: 2,4,6,...,52 (total 26)</p>
<p>Placement constraints:<br />
- The four '1's must all be in even positions.<br />
- The four '2's must all be in odd positions.<br />
- The remaining cards (3-13, 4 copies each = 48 cards) can be placed in any remaining positions.</p>
<p>Number of favorable arrangements:<br />
- Choose 4 positions out of 26 even positions for '1's: C(26,4)<br />
- Choose 4 positions out of 26 odd positions for '2's: C(26,4)<br />
- Arrange the 4 '1's in the selected positions: 4! (but this is already accounted for in the combinations)<br />
- Arrange the 4 '2's among their positions: similarly, 4!<br />
- Arrange the remaining 48 cards in the remaining 44 positions (since total positions: 52 - 8 allocated to '1's and '2's): factorial(44) / (factorial(4)^11) for the remaining card distribution (each of remaining 3-13 ranks appears 4 times).</p>
<p>However, since the focus is on the ratio of favorable to total arrangements, and the identical copies are indistinguishable in permutations, the probability simplifies to:</p>
<p>Probability = [Number of arrangements with '1's in even positions and '2's in odd positions] / [Total arrangements].</p>
<p>Total arrangements:<br />
- The total arrangements are:<br />
  total = factorial(52) / (factorial(4)^13)</p>
<p>Favorable arrangements:<br />
- For '1's:<br />
  - Number of ways to choose positions: C(26,4)<br />
  - Permutations of '1's in these positions: 1 (identical cards; permutations don't increase count)<br />
- For '2's:<br />
  - Number of ways to choose positions: C(26,4)<br />
  - Permutations: 1<br />
- Remaining 44 positions:<br />
  - Remaining cards (lap all of the 3-13 ranks): 44 cards with each rank 4 copies<br />
  - Number of arrangements: factorial(44) / (factorial(4)^11)</p>
<p>Because the identical nature of cards cancels out in probability ratios, and considering uniform random shuffling, the probability of the arrangement where '1's are in even positions and '2's are in odd positions is:</p>
<p>Probability = [C(26,4) * C(26,4) * (remaining arrangements count)] / total arrangements</p>
<p>But since the remaining arrangements and total arrangements are the same regardless of specific placements (given the symmetry), the probability reduces to:</p>
<p>P = [C(26,4) * C(26,4)] * (factorial(44) / factorial(52)) * (factorial(4)^13 / factorial(4)^13)</p>
<p>After cancelling common factors, the final probability simplifies to:</p>
<p>P = [C(26,4) * C(26,4)] / C(52,4) for the '1' cards times similarly for '2'</p>
<p>But the exact derivation considering all permutations leads to the conclusion that:</p>
<p>Probability of winning = (number of arrangements where all '1's are in even positions and all '2's are in odd positions) divided by total arrangements.</p>
<p>Given the symmetry and the assignments:</p>
<p>The count of favorable arrangements:<br />
- For '1's: C(26,4)<br />
- For '2's: C(26,4)<br />
- For remaining cards, their arrangements are unaffected.</p>
<p>Hence, the probability of winning is:</p>
<p>[ \frac{C(26,4) \times C(26,4)}{C(52,4) \times C(48,4) \times... } ]</p>
<p>But focusing primarily on the placement of '1's and '2's:</p>
<p>Final formula:</p>
<p>[<br />
\boxed{<br />
\frac{<br />
C(26,4) \times C(26,4)<br />
}{<br />
C(52,4) \times C(48,4) \times \ldots<br />
}<br />
}<br />
]</p>
<p>which simplifies to the probability that no '1's are in odd positions and no '2's are in even positions, relative to the total arrangements.</p>
<p>In practice, since only the placement of '1's and '2's affects the game outcome:</p>

<p><reasoning><br />
The game involves drawing cards sequentially from a deck with 52 cards, each rank from 1 to 13 appearing exactly 4 times, and checking if the cycling counter matches the card's value at each draw. The counter alternates between 1 and 2, with the sequence 1, 2, 1, 2,... regardless of the position in the deck. </p>
<p>To find the probability of winning, we note the following:<br />
- The deck's composition is fixed and known (each rank occurs exactly 4 times).<br />
- The order of cards is uniform over all permutations since the deck is shuffled uniformly at random.<br />
- For each position i in the deck, the card's rank is a random variable dependent on the permutation.<br />
- The counter at position i is deterministic: it alternates between 1 and 2, starting with 1 at the first card.</p>
<p>The game is lost if, at any position i, the card's rank equals the counter value at that position. The game is won if, for all positions, the card's rank does not match the counter.</p>
<p>Let's define:<br />
- N = 52 (total number of cards)<br />
- R_i = rank of the card at position i<br />
- C_i = counter at position i (alternates between 1 and 2, starting with 1 at i=1)</p>
<p>The first card's counter is 1, the second is 2, and so on:<br />
$$<br />
C_i = 1 + (i \bmod 2)<br />
$$<br />
which alternates between 1 and 2.</p>
<p>We need the probability that for all i, ( R_i \neq C_i ). Equivalently, the probability that no card's rank equals the counter at its position.</p>
<p>Since the permutation is uniform, the positions of specific ranks are equally distributed over all permutations. </p>
<p>Given equal cardinality, to calculate the probability that the game is won, we observe:<br />
- For positions where ( C_i=1 ), the card cannot be any of the 4 cards with rank 1.<br />
- For positions where ( C_i=2 ), the card cannot be any of the 4 cards with rank 2.</p>
<p>Number of such positions:<br />
- Positions where ( C_i=1 ): positions i where i is odd (since counting from 1, odd positions correspond to counter=1). Total: 26.<br />
- Positions where ( C_i=2 ): positions i where i is even. Total: 26.</p>
<p>The total number of permutations is:<br />
$$<br />
\text{Total permutations} = 52!<br />
$$</p>
<p>Number of permutations avoiding a particular rank in certain positions:<br />
- The positions where the rank-1 cards cannot appear (the 26 odd positions): these positions cannot contain any of the 4 rank-1 cards.<br />
- Similarly for rank 2 and even positions.</p>
<p>Total constraints:<br />
- The 4 rank-1 cards must be placed only in positions where ( C_i \neq 1 ), i.e., even positions (which are 26 in total).<br />
- The same applies for rank 2 cards: they cannot be in odd positions.</p>
<p>Thus, to ensure no match occurs:<br />
- The 4 rank-1 cards are placed among the 26 even positions,<br />
- The 4 rank-2 cards are placed among the 26 odd positions,<br />
- The remaining cards (the other 44 cards) can be any remaining positions.</p>
<p>Within these constraints, the number of valid permutations where:<br />
- Rank-1 cards occupy 4 distinct positions among the 26 even positions<br />
- Rank-2 cards occupy 4 distinct positions among the 26 odd positions<br />
- The remaining 44 cards are allocated freely in the remaining positions</p>
<p>Number of arrangements:<br />
$$<br />
\binom{26}{4} \times 4! \quad \text{(for rank-1 in even positions)} \<br />
\binom{26}{4} \times 4! \quad \text{(for rank-2 in odd positions)} \<br />
\end{aligned}<br />
$$</p>
<p>Remaining 44 cards are placed in remaining 44 positions in any order:<br />
$$<br />
44!<br />
$$</p>
<p>Total favorable permutations:<br />
$$<br />
\left[ \binom{26}{4} \times 4! \right]^2 \times 44!<br />
$$</p>
<p>Probability of winning:<br />
$$<br />
P = \frac{\left(\binom{26}{4} \times 4!\right)^2 \times 44!}{52!}<br />
$$</p>
<p>Utilizing factorial expressions and combining:<br />
$$<br />
P = \frac{\left( \binom{26}{4} \times 4! \right)^2 \times 44!}{52!}<br />
$$</p>
<p>which simplifies further to a concrete expression involving factorials and combinations.</p>

<p><reasoning><br />
To determine the probability of winning this game, we need to analyze the structure of the game mechanics and the randomness involved.</p>
<p>Important observations:<br />
- The deck contains 52 cards with 4 copies each of ranks 1 through 13.<br />
- The cards are shuffled uniformly at random.<br />
- The counter alternates between 1 and 2 with each card dealt: sequence 1, 2, 1, 2,...<br />
- The game is lost if at any point the counter (either 1 or 2) matches the card's rank.<br />
- The game is won if, after dealing all 52 cards, no such match occurs.</p>
<p>We observe that:<br />
- The counter sequence is deterministic given the dealing order.<br />
- The randomness arises from the order of the cards, which can be viewed as a random permutation of the multiset containing 4 each of ranks 1-13.<br />
- For each position i in the deck, the card's rank is a certain value, and the counter at position i is either 1 or 2 based on the dealing pattern.</p>
<p>Step-by-step derivation:<br />
1. Define the deck as a random permutation of 4 copies of each rank 1–13.<br />
2. For each position i, the counter c_i is fixed: c_i = 1 if i is odd, c_i = 2 if i is even.<br />
3. The game is lost if, for any i, the rank r_i equals c_i. Otherwise, the player wins.</p>
<p>The problem reduces to:<br />
- Compute the probability that in a random permutation of the multiset {4 of each of 13 ranks}, none of the positions i where c_i = rank equals c_i.</p>
<p>Because the counter sequence is deterministic and alternating, the problem is symmetric with respect to the positions:<br />
- For positions where c_i = 1 (i.e., odd positions): the calculated probability that none of these positions contain the rank 1.<br />
- For positions where c_i = 2 (even positions): the probability that none of these positions contain the rank 2.</p>
<p>We notice the symmetry that each rank appears exactly 4 times among the total 52 cards, and positions are symmetric with the shuffling being uniform.</p>
<p>The key is calculating the probability that, for each specific rank, none of its 4 copies appear at any position where the counter matches that rank's value.</p>
<p>Formalism:<br />
- For each rank r, there are 4 cards to be placed.<br />
- For each such rank, the total number of positions with counter c_i = r (positions where position i satisfies c_i = r) is 26, since the sequence alternates 1, 2 and there are 52 cards.</p>
<p>Thus:<br />
- For rank 1, the 4 copies must not be in the positions where c_i = 1 (which are 26 positions).<br />
- For rank 2, the 4 copies must not be in the positions where c_i = 2 (also 26 positions).<br />
- For ranks 3–13, the 4 copies can be freely in any positions, with no restrictions.</p>
<p>The probability of a "safe" placement for each rank r (r=1,2) is:<br />
- The probability that the 4 copies of rank r are not in the positions where c_i = rank (i.e., not in the 26 positions assigned to that rank's counter value).</p>
<p>Number of favorable arrangements for rank r:<br />
- Number of ways to choose the 4 positions for rank r outside the "matched" positions: C(26,4)<br />
- Total number of ways to place 4 copies of rank r in any positions: C(52,4)</p>
<p>Hence, the probability that all 4 copies of rank r avoid the positions where c_i = r is:<br />
P_r = C(26,4) / C(52,4)</p>
<p>Since the placements for different ranks are dependent (due to the fixed total of positions), and the placements of the card copies are uniformly distributed over all permutations, the probability that none of the 4 copies of rank 1 are in the 26 "danger" positions is approximately P_1.</p>
<p>Similarly for rank 2: P_2 = C(26,4) / C(52,4).</p>
<p>For ranks 3–13, the placement is unconstrained, so the probability that none of the 4 copies of these ranks are in their respective "danger" positions is 1 (since their placements are independent of the restriction).</p>
<p>The overall probability that no "dangerous" placement occurs (i.e., no rank's copies are in their dangerous positions) is approximated by the product over r=1 to 2 (since these are the only problematic ranks):</p>
<p>P_win ≈ (P_1) * (P_2)</p>
<p>This approximation assumes independence, which is reasonable due to symmetry and the uniform randomness over permutations.</p>
<p>Final formula:<br />
- The exact probability is:</p>
<p>\boxed{<br />
\left( \frac{C(26,4)}{C(52,4)} \right)^2<br />
}</p>
<p>since ranks 1 and 2 are the only ones with immediate "danger" positions to avoid, and the placements are independent.</p>

<p><reasoning><br />
To determine the probability of winning this card matching game, we need to analyze the process step by step, considering the sequential dealing of the deck and the fixed rules for counter cycling and matching.</p>
<p>Important observations:<br />
1. The deck contains 52 cards, with four copies each of the 13 ranks (1-13).<br />
2. The deck is shuffled uniformly at random, so any permutation of the deck is equally likely.<br />
3. The counter alternates between 1 and 2 upon each deal, starting from 0, so the sequence of counter values for each card dealt is deterministic:<br />
   - First card: count = 1<br />
   - Second card: count = 2<br />
   - Third card: count = 1<br />
   - Fourth card: count = 2<br />
   -... and so forth.</p>
<p>The pattern of counter values is therefore:</p>
<p>For position i (1-based),<br />
   count = 1 if i is odd<br />
   count = 2 if i is even</p>
<ol>
<li>We lose if at any point the counter matches the card rank; I.e., if:</li>
</ol>
<p>count = card_rank.</p>
<ol>
<li>The game is won if none of the first 52 positions have a card whose rank equals the counter at that position.</li>
</ol>
<p>Derivation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Since the deck is random, the positions of each rank are uniformly distributed among the 52 positions.</li>
<li>For each rank r in {1,..., 13}:</li>
<li>There are exactly 4 cards of this rank.</li>
<li>
<p>The positions of these 4 cards are uniformly distributed over the 52 positions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The risk occurs only at positions where the counter equals that rank, which is at positions where:</p>
</li>
<li>i is odd and count = 1, so loss condition for card rank 1 at odd positions.</li>
<li>
<p>i is even and count = 2, so loss condition for card rank 2 at even positions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For each rank r, the positions where the game risks losing are positions where the counter equals r:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If r = 1, the risky positions are all odd positions: 1,3,5,...,51.</p>
</li>
<li>If r = 2, the risky positions are all even positions: 2,4,6,...,52.</li>
<li>For any other rank r &gt; 2, the counter never equals r at any position, so these ranks do not cause a loss.</li>
</ul>
<p>Calculating the probability:</p>
<ul>
<li>For each rank r, the 4 cards of that rank are uniformly randomly distributed among the 52 positions.</li>
<li>
<p>The number of positions where the counter equals r is:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>26 positions (either odd or even) depending on r:</p>
<ul>
<li>For r=1, 26 odd positions.</li>
<li>For r=2, 26 even positions.</li>
<li>For r&gt;2, 0 positions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The probability that all 4 cards of rank r avoid the risky positions is given by the probability that all 4 randomly placed cards of this rank are not in the risky positions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For rank r=1:</p>
</li>
<li>Number of favorable positions: total positions (52) minus the 26 risky positions (odd positions)</li>
<li>So, 26 "safe" positions for each card.</li>
<li>
<p>The probability that all 4 cards are placed outside these 26 positions:</p>
<p>[<br />
P_{r=1} = \frac{\binom{26}{4}}{\binom{52}{4}}<br />
]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similarly for rank r=2:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>[<br />
  P_{r=2} = \frac{\binom{26}{4}}{\binom{52}{4}}<br />
  ]</p>
<ul>
<li>For ranks r &gt; 2:</li>
<li>
<p>Since the counter never equals r, there are no positions where the rank could cause a loss; hence, they always avoid the loss condition regardless of placement:</p>
<p>[<br />
P_{r&gt;2} = 1<br />
]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All ranks are independent in placement; the total probability of winning is the product over all ranks:</p>

  P(\text{win}) = P_{r=1} \times P_{r=2} \times \prod_{r=3}^{13} 1 = P_{r=1} \times P_{r=2}<br />
