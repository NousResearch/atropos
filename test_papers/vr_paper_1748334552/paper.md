# VR Performance Analysis: A Practical Study

## Abstract
This study presents a comprehensive performance analysis of VRTestApp 
        using automated testing methodologies. We conducted 1 performance tests 
        with a 100.0% success rate. 
        
        Key findings include: Average frame rate: 85.3 FPS (std: 0.0); Best performing GPU: T4 (85.3 FPS); Average VR comfort score: 87.2/100. 
        
        The results provide insights into VR performance characteristics and identify optimization opportunities 
        for improved user experience. Our methodology demonstrates the effectiveness of automated performance 
        testing for VR application analysis.
