Abstract**\n\nThis paper presents the results of a performance analysis of a Virtual Reality (VR) application, \"SpatialWorkshop,\" using the Real CloudVR-PerfGuard automated testing platform.  The study involved 245 test runs, achieving a 100% success rate across a diverse range of hardware configurations.  The primary performance metrics evaluated were frames per second (FPS), frame time, and subjective user comfort scores.  Analysis revealed an average FPS of 58.9 (std: 11.3), with a 95th percentile frame time of 22.7ms, indicating a generally smooth VR experience.  The average comfort score was 75.3/100, suggesting areas for potential optimization.  The study highlights the importance of automated performance testing in VR development and identifies key areas for future optimization efforts to improve both performance and user experience, focusing on minimizing frame time variability and achieving higher consistency in frame rates to enhance the immersion and comfort of VR interactions.  The results provide valuable insights for developers aiming to create high-quality and performant VR applications.\n\n\n**2. Introduction**\n\nThe increasing adoption of Virtual Reality (VR) technology demands robust performance optimization strategies to ensure a compelling and immersive user experience.  Lag, stuttering, and low frame rates can lead to motion sickness, disorientation, and diminished user engagement.  Maintaining a high and consistent frame rate (FPS) is crucial for delivering a smooth, responsive, and enjoyable VR experience.  Frame time, the inverse of FPS, is equally important; minimizing its variability is essential for reducing the perceived jerkiness and improving comfort.  This study focuses on evaluating the performance of a VR application, \"SpatialWorkshop,\" utilizing automated testing methodologies to provide quantitative data on its performance characteristics and identify areas for optimization.\n\n\n**3. Methodology**\n\nThis research employed the Real CloudVR-PerfGuard automated testing platform to analyze the performance of SpatialWorkshop.  The platform executed 245 independent test runs across a range of hardware configurations.  Each test run involved a predefined sequence of actions within the SpatialWorkshop application, designed to simulate typical user interaction scenarios.  Performance data, including FPS and frame time, were collected throughout each run.  Subjective user comfort scores, ranging from 0 to 100, were also recorded after each test, gathered through post-test questionnaires.  Statistical analysis, including mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum, and 95th percentile values, were calculated for all performance metrics.\n\n\n**4. Results**\n\nThe automated testing yielded the following key performance metrics:\n\n* **FPS Statistics:** Mean: 58.94 FPS (std: 11.26), Min: 37.9 FPS, Max: 92.2 FPS, Median: 57.2 FPS, 95th Percentile: 80.6 FPS.\n* **Frame Time Statistics:** Mean: 17.56 ms (std: 3.19), Min: 10.84 ms, Max: 26.36 ms, Median: 17.49 ms, 95th Percentile: 22.72 ms.\n* **Comfort Score Statistics:** Mean: 75.30/100 (std: 7.35), Min: 60.6/100, Max: 95.1/100, Median: 74.3/100, 95th Percentile: 89.22/100.\n\nThe high standard deviation in FPS (11.26) and frame time (3.19) suggests variability in performance across different hardware configurations and scenarios within the application. Preliminary analysis revealed that the RTX4090 GPU achieved the highest average FPS (71.0 FPS).\n\n**5. Discussion**\n\nThe results indicate that SpatialWorkshop delivers a generally acceptable VR experience, with an average FPS above the commonly recommended threshold for smooth VR interaction (45-60 FPS).  However, the significant standard deviation highlights performance inconsistencies. The 95th percentile frame time of 22.7ms suggests that occasional frame drops occur, potentially impacting user comfort. The average comfort score of 75.3/100, while acceptable, reveals room for improvement.  Further analysis should focus on identifying the specific scenarios and hardware configurations leading to performance fluctuations. Optimization opportunities include:\n\n* **Profiling:**  Detailed profiling to pinpoint performance bottlenecks within the application's code.\n* **GPU Optimization:**  Investigating GPU-specific optimization techniques to improve rendering efficiency.\n* **Asset Optimization:**  Reducing the polygon count and texture resolutions of 3D models to minimize rendering load.\n* **Adaptive Rendering:**  Implementing techniques that dynamically adjust rendering quality based on available GPU resources.\n\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nThis study provides valuable quantitative data on the performance of the SpatialWorkshop VR application.  The average FPS and comfort scores are satisfactory, but the observed variability highlights the need for further optimization.  Automated testing, as demonstrated by the use of Real CloudVR-PerfGuard, is crucial for efficient performance analysis and iterative improvement.  Future work will focus on detailed profiling to pinpoint performance bottlenecks, implementing targeted optimization strategies, and conducting further user studies to refine the comfort score analysis and validate the effectiveness of optimization efforts.  This research emphasizes the importance of continuous performance monitoring and optimization in the development of high-quality VR experiences.\n",
