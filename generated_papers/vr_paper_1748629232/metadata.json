Abstract**\n\nThis paper presents the findings of a performance analysis study conducted on the SpatialWorkshop platform using Real CloudVR-PerfGuard.  The study evaluated the real-world performance of a single application across 374 automated test runs, achieving a 100% success rate over a total duration of 44651.36 seconds.  Key performance metrics, including frames per second (FPS), frame time, and a subjective comfort score, were collected and analyzed. Results indicate an average FPS of 58.9 (std: 11.2), with a 95th percentile frame time of 22.6ms, suggesting generally smooth performance.  The average comfort score of 75.3/100 points to a reasonably comfortable VR experience.  However, the observed standard deviation in FPS highlights performance variability, indicating potential optimization opportunities.  Further analysis reveals the RTX 4090 as the top-performing GPU, achieving 71.0 FPS on average. This study contributes to understanding real-world VR performance characteristics and provides insights for developers aiming to enhance the quality and consistency of VR applications.  Future work will explore the impact of different hardware configurations and application settings on performance.\n\n\n**2. Introduction**\n\nVirtual Reality (VR) experiences are increasingly reliant on high frame rates and low latency to provide immersive and comfortable interactions.  Poor performance, characterized by low frame rates, stuttering, and high frame times, can lead to motion sickness, reduced user engagement, and ultimately, a negative user experience.  Therefore, understanding and optimizing VR application performance is crucial for the widespread adoption and success of VR technology.  This study focuses on analyzing the real-world performance of a VR application deployed on the SpatialWorkshop platform, utilizing automated testing to provide a comprehensive evaluation of its stability and user experience.  The aim is to identify areas for improvement and provide insights into practical optimization strategies for VR developers.\n\n\n**3. Methodology**\n\nThis study employed Real CloudVR-PerfGuard, an automated VR performance testing framework, to evaluate a single VR application deployed on the SpatialWorkshop platform.  The testing involved 374 automated test runs under varying conditions, simulating real-world usage patterns.  The framework automatically collected performance data including FPS, frame time, and a subjective comfort score (on a scale of 0-100, derived from a pre-defined algorithm analyzing frame rate stability and latency). The comfort score aims to provide a holistic measure of the user experience considering both performance metrics and their impact on comfort.  All tests were completed successfully, resulting in a 100% success rate.  Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, including mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, median, and the 95th percentile to characterize the distribution of performance metrics.  GPU performance was also examined based on the hardware configurations used during the tests.\n\n**4. Results**\n\nThe analysis of the collected data revealed the following key findings:\n\n* **FPS Statistics:** The average FPS was 58.9 (std: 11.2), with a minimum of 38.1 FPS and a maximum of 92.4 FPS. The median FPS was 57.3, and the 95th percentile was 78.2 FPS.\n* **Frame Time Statistics:** The average frame time was 17.57ms (std: 3.20ms), with a minimum of 10.82ms and a maximum of 26.22ms. The median frame time was 17.43ms, and the 95th percentile was 22.62ms.\n* **Comfort Score Statistics:** The average comfort score was 75.3/100 (std: 7.35), ranging from a minimum of 60.8 to a maximum of 95.1. The median comfort score was 74.45, and the 95th percentile was 87.8.\n* **GPU Performance:**  The RTX 4090 demonstrated the highest average FPS at 71.0.\n\nThese results indicate that while the application generally performs well, significant variability exists in both FPS and comfort scores.  The relatively high standard deviation in FPS suggests potential bottlenecks or inconsistencies in performance.  The 95th percentile frame time of 22.6ms, while acceptable, indicates that occasional frame drops might occur, potentially impacting user experience.\n\n**5. Discussion**\n\nThe observed performance variability warrants further investigation.  Potential contributing factors include variations in scene complexity, GPU limitations, and potential CPU bottlenecks. The high standard deviation in FPS and comfort scores highlights the need for further optimization efforts to ensure a consistently smooth and comfortable VR experience for all users.  Future work could involve profiling the application to identify performance hotspots and optimizing specific sections of the code.  Analyzing the relationship between scene complexity and performance metrics would also provide valuable insights for targeted optimization.  The identification of the RTX 4090 as the top performer suggests a correlation between GPU capabilities and VR performance, underscoring the importance of hardware selection for optimal VR experiences.\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nThis study provides valuable insights into the real-world performance characteristics of a VR application within the SpatialWorkshop environment. The average FPS of 58.9 and average comfort score of 75.3 suggest acceptable performance, but the significant standard deviation highlights areas for improvement. The 95th percentile frame time of 22.6ms suggests potential for optimization to minimize occasional frame drops. Future work will involve detailed profiling to pinpoint performance bottlenecks, testing on a broader range of hardware configurations, and exploring various optimization techniques to achieve more consistent and high-quality VR experiences. This research emphasizes the importance of automated performance testing and the need for continuous optimization in VR development to ensure a positive user experience.\n",
