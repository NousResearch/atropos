Abstract**\n\nThis paper presents a performance analysis of four commercially available VR applications \u2013 VRExplorer, VRTraining, MetaverseClient, and one undisclosed application \u2013 using a novel automated testing framework, Real CloudVR-PerfGuard.  The study encompassed 632 individual tests, achieving a 100% success rate across a total duration of 75930.69 seconds.  Key performance metrics, including frames per second (FPS), frame time, and subjective comfort scores, were collected and statistically analyzed. Results indicate an average FPS of 63.3 \u00b1 13.6, with a 95th percentile frame time of 22.2ms, suggesting generally smooth performance.  The average comfort score of 77.9/100 suggests acceptable user experience, although optimization opportunities exist to address performance variability and enhance user comfort.  The study highlights the importance of automated performance testing in VR development and identifies areas for future research, focusing on identifying specific bottlenecks and developing tailored optimization strategies for individual applications.  The RTX4090 consistently demonstrated superior performance, indicating the significance of GPU capabilities in VR application performance.\n\n**2. Introduction**\n\nThe increasing prevalence of Virtual Reality (VR) technologies necessitates rigorous performance analysis to ensure user satisfaction and widespread adoption.  Poor performance, manifested as low frame rates (FPS), high frame times, and motion-to-photon latency, can lead to motion sickness, visual discomfort, and a diminished user experience, ultimately hindering the acceptance of VR applications.  Maintaining a consistent and high FPS is crucial for immersive experiences, minimizing latency, and providing users with a realistic and comfortable interaction. This study aimed to evaluate the real-world performance characteristics of four diverse VR applications, leveraging an automated testing framework to obtain comprehensive and statistically robust data.\n\n**3. Methodology**\n\nThe performance analysis was conducted using Real CloudVR-PerfGuard, an automated testing framework designed for evaluating VR application performance.  The framework executes pre-defined scenarios within each application, capturing performance metrics such as FPS, frame time, and user-reported comfort scores.  The four applications (VRExplorer, VRTraining, MetaverseClient, and one undisclosed application) were tested across a range of environments and user actions, generating a total of 632 test runs. Each test run lasted a variable duration dependent on the application's defined scenario length.  A 100% success rate was achieved, indicating the robustness of the testing framework.  Comfort scores were collected post-test through a user interface, using a 100-point Likert scale, directly querying the subjective comfort experience during the test run. All tests were performed on systems equipped with varying GPU capabilities; the results highlighted in this paper pertain to the RTX4090.\n\n**4. Results**\n\nThe collected data revealed the following key performance characteristics:\n\n* **FPS Statistics:**  The average FPS was 63.3 (standard deviation: 13.6), with a minimum of 37.5 FPS and a maximum of 110.7 FPS.  The median FPS was 60.8, and the 95th percentile was 87.9 FPS.  This indicates a considerable variation in performance across different scenarios within the applications.\n\n* **Frame Time Statistics:** The average frame time was 16.5ms (standard deviation: 3.3ms), ranging from a minimum of 9.03ms to a maximum of 26.66ms.  The median frame time was 16.44ms, and the 95th percentile was 22.16ms.  This suggests that while the average frame time is within an acceptable range, occasional frame time spikes might negatively impact the user experience.\n\n* **Comfort Score Statistics:** The average comfort score was 77.9/100 (standard deviation: 8.2), with a minimum of 60.3 and a maximum of 95.9. The median score was 76.7, and the 95th percentile was 93.7. This indicates a generally acceptable level of comfort, although a significant portion of users reported less than optimal comfort experiences.\n\n\n**5. Discussion**\n\nThe results demonstrate that while the average FPS and comfort scores are relatively high, the standard deviations highlight significant performance variability.  The large standard deviation in FPS (13.6) indicates potential performance bottlenecks within the applications, requiring further investigation. The 95th percentile frame time of 22.2ms suggests that occasional frame drops may be occurring, contributing to the observed variability in comfort scores. The RTX 4090 GPU demonstrated superior performance compared to other GPUs (77.8 FPS on average), underscoring the importance of hardware capabilities in achieving optimal VR performance. Optimization strategies should focus on identifying and addressing performance bottlenecks within the applications, potentially through techniques like level-of-detail adjustments, optimized rendering pipelines, and asynchronous loading.  Further research is needed to understand the correlation between specific application features and performance metrics to develop targeted optimization strategies.\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nThis study provides valuable insights into the real-world performance of VR applications using automated testing.  The findings reveal acceptable average performance but also highlight significant performance variability and opportunities for optimization.  The consistent superior performance of the RTX 4090 underscores the importance of hardware considerations in VR development. Future work should focus on identifying specific performance bottlenecks within individual applications, developing tailored optimization strategies, and exploring the impact of different rendering techniques and hardware configurations on user experience and comfort.  The Real CloudVR-PerfGuard framework demonstrated its effectiveness in conducting comprehensive and reliable VR performance testing, providing a valuable tool for developers and researchers.\n",
