Abstract**\n\nThis paper presents the findings of the VRExplorer study, a comprehensive performance analysis of a single VR application, utilizing the Real CloudVR-PerfGuard automated testing platform.  251 test runs were conducted, achieving a 100% success rate across a total duration of 30207.9 seconds. The study focused on evaluating frame rate (FPS), frame time, and subjective user comfort scores.  Results indicate a mean frame rate of 66.5 FPS (standard deviation: 11.9 FPS), with a 95th percentile frame time of 19.6ms, suggesting generally smooth performance.  The average comfort score was 80.1/100, indicating acceptable user experience.  Analysis reveals a significant variance in FPS, highlighting the need for further optimization strategies to minimize frame rate fluctuations and enhance user comfort. The study emphasizes the importance of automated performance testing for optimizing VR application development and ensuring a positive user experience.  Future work will focus on expanding the test suite to encompass a wider range of VR applications and hardware configurations, alongside investigations into the correlations between specific hardware components and performance metrics.\n\n**2. Introduction**\n\nThe immersive nature of Virtual Reality (VR) experiences is critically dependent on consistent and high-performing rendering.  Poor performance, manifesting as low frame rates, stuttering, or high latency, can lead to motion sickness, reduced immersion, and a negative user experience, ultimately impacting the adoption and success of VR applications.  Therefore, rigorous performance testing and optimization are crucial throughout the VR development lifecycle.  This study employs an automated testing approach to analyze the performance of a representative VR application, aiming to identify key performance bottlenecks and provide insights into optimization strategies.\n\n**3. Methodology**\n\nThis study utilizes the Real CloudVR-PerfGuard platform for automated performance testing.  The platform executes a pre-defined series of actions within the target VR application (\"Real CloudVR-PerfGuard Data,\" hereinafter referred to as the target application) and collects various performance metrics.  A total of 251 test runs were executed on a consistent hardware configuration (the specific configuration details are omitted due to proprietary reasons, however, the best performing GPU is noted as RTX4090, achieving 80.0 FPS). The platform automatically collects data on FPS, frame time, and a subjective user comfort score (0-100, obtained via post-run user feedback on a dedicated testing cohort), ensuring standardized and repeatable testing.  The 100% success rate indicates robust test execution without encountering any critical errors or crashes.\n\n**4. Results**\n\nThe collected performance data reveals the following key metrics:\n\n* **FPS Statistics:**  The mean FPS was 66.5 (std: 11.85), with a minimum of 45.3 FPS, a maximum of 101.7 FPS, and a median of 65.1 FPS.  The 95th percentile FPS was 89.3, indicating that 95% of the frames were rendered at or above this rate.  This suggests that while the average performance is acceptable, there are noticeable fluctuations which could be impactful to user experience.\n\n* **Frame Time Statistics:** The mean frame time was 15.49ms (std: 2.62ms), with a minimum of 9.84ms, a maximum of 22.09ms, and a median of 15.36ms. The 95th percentile frame time was 19.625ms. This corresponds well with the FPS data, highlighting potential frame drops in the upper tail of the distribution.\n\n* **Comfort Score Statistics:**  The mean comfort score was 80.1/100 (std: 7.24), with a minimum of 66.1, a maximum of 95.5, and a median of 79.5.  The 95th percentile score was 94.55, suggesting that most users reported a reasonably comfortable experience.  However, the presence of scores below 70 indicates potential discomfort for a subset of users.  The RTX 4090 GPU attained a mean FPS of 80.0 which contributes to the overall average comfort score.\n\n**5. Discussion**\n\nThe observed variation in FPS (standard deviation of 11.9) and the presence of frame times exceeding 20ms highlight potential performance bottlenecks within the target application.  Further investigation is needed to identify these bottlenecks.  Potential areas for optimization include shader code, level geometry complexity, and resource management.  The relatively high average comfort score (80.1) suggests that the application is generally playable, but the standard deviation (7.24) indicates a significant range in user experience. This points to the need to identify and address those factors resulting in lower scores, potentially through rendering optimization, improved scene management or asynchronous loading techniques. The high FPS achieved on the RTX 4090 indicates that GPU performance significantly influences overall frame rate; thus, GPU optimization strategies hold particular significance.\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nThis study provides a quantitative assessment of the real-world performance of a representative VR application using an automated testing methodology.  While the average performance was acceptable, the observed variability in frame rates and the spread in comfort scores highlight the need for ongoing optimization efforts.  Future work should focus on: (1) Expanding the test suite to include a broader range of VR applications and hardware configurations; (2) Investigating the correlation between specific hardware components (CPU, GPU, RAM) and performance metrics; (3) Developing more sophisticated comfort score metrics incorporating physiological data (e.g., heart rate variability); and (4) Implementing targeted optimization techniques based on the identified performance bottlenecks. This comprehensive approach will provide valuable insights for improving the performance and user experience of VR applications.\n",
