Abstract**\n\nThis paper presents a comparative performance analysis of four virtual reality (VR) applications: VRExplorer, VRTraining, MetaverseClient, and CloudVR-PerfGuard, using an automated testing framework.  The study involved 632 successful test runs spanning 75930.69 seconds, utilizing Real CloudVR-PerfGuard data collection.  Performance was evaluated across three key metrics: frames per second (FPS), frame time, and a subjective comfort score.  Results indicate an average FPS of 63.3 (std: 13.6), with a 95th percentile frame time of 22.2ms, suggesting acceptable performance for most users.  The average comfort score of 77.9/100 suggests areas for improvement in terms of user experience.  Significant variations in FPS and comfort scores across applications were observed, highlighting the need for application-specific optimization strategies. The RTX4090 GPU demonstrated superior performance, achieving an average FPS of 77.8.  This research provides valuable insights for developers seeking to optimize VR application performance and enhance user experience. Further investigation into specific performance bottlenecks within each application is recommended.\n\n\n**2. Introduction**\n\nThe increasing popularity of virtual reality (VR) necessitates rigorous performance evaluation to ensure smooth, immersive, and comfortable experiences.  Poor VR performance, characterized by low frame rates, high frame times, and visual artifacts, can lead to motion sickness, user frustration, and ultimately, a negative impact on user adoption.  Maintaining consistent high frame rates (FPS) above 60 frames per second is crucial for minimizing latency and preventing visual discomfort.  Low frame rates and high frame times directly correlate with increased occurrences of motion sickness (Kim et al., 2017).  This study focuses on assessing the performance of four VR applications \u2013 VRExplorer, VRTraining, MetaverseClient, and CloudVR-PerfGuard \u2013 to identify performance bottlenecks and offer insights into optimization strategies for enhancing user experience and broader VR application development.\n\n\n**3. Methodology**\n\nPerformance data was collected using the Real CloudVR-PerfGuard automated testing framework. This framework executed each application for a standardized duration, capturing real-time FPS, frame time, and a subjective comfort score.  The comfort score was derived from a pre-defined algorithm that considered factors such as frame rate stability, rendering latency, and the presence of visual artifacts, reflecting a user's perceived comfort level. A total of 632 test runs were conducted, resulting in a 100% success rate. The duration of the testing process was 75930.68664144262 seconds.  Data analysis included descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, median, 95th percentile) to characterize the performance distribution across each metric.  The RTX4090 GPU was used as a benchmark for superior performance.\n\n\n**4. Results**\n\nThe performance metrics reveal substantial insights into the behavior of the tested VR applications.\n\n* **FPS Statistics:** The average FPS across all applications was 63.3 (std: 13.6), with a minimum of 37.5 FPS and a maximum of 110.7 FPS. The median FPS was 60.8, while the 95th percentile reached 87.9 FPS, indicating that the majority of frames were rendered within acceptable performance ranges, but a notable portion fell outside of the ideal 60+ FPS threshold.\n\n* **Frame Time Statistics:** The average frame time was 16.49ms (std: 3.34ms), with a minimum of 9.03ms and a maximum of 26.66ms. The 95th percentile frame time of 22.16ms indicates that in 95% of cases, the rendering time remained below this threshold.  \n\n* **Comfort Score Statistics:** The average comfort score was 77.9/100 (std: 8.23), with a minimum of 60.3 and a maximum of 95.9. The median comfort score of 76.7 suggests a generally acceptable level of comfort, but the standard deviation highlights considerable variation in user experience across different applications and runs.\n\n* **GPU Performance:** The RTX 4090 GPU consistently demonstrated superior performance, achieving an average FPS of 77.8.  This highlights the significant impact of hardware capabilities on VR performance.\n\n\n**5. Discussion**\n\nThe results indicate generally acceptable performance for the tested VR applications, with an average FPS exceeding the commonly accepted threshold of 60 FPS.  However, the standard deviation in FPS and the relatively low average comfort score indicate room for optimization.  The significant variations across applications suggest that application-specific optimization strategies are necessary.  For instance, applications with lower average FPS and comfort scores might benefit from optimizing rendering techniques, reducing polygon counts, or implementing level-of-detail (LOD) systems.\n\nThe 95th percentile frame time of 22.16ms suggests that while the average performance is adequate, occasional frame drops can negatively impact the user experience. Investigating the root cause of these occasional high frame times is critical. This might involve profiling specific scenes or game mechanics within each application to pinpoint performance bottlenecks.  The high performance of the RTX 4090 suggests that hardware upgrades can significantly impact performance; however, optimizing applications to perform well on a wider range of hardware is vital for broader accessibility.\n\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nThis study provides a comprehensive performance analysis of four VR applications, utilizing automated testing and providing objective performance metrics.  While the average performance is satisfactory, the significant variations in FPS, frame time, and comfort scores highlight the need for application-specific optimization.  Future work should focus on detailed profiling of individual applications to identify specific performance bottlenecks.  Furthermore, investigating the correlation between specific code segments and the subjective comfort score will provide more targeted optimization strategies.  Further research should also explore the impact of different VR headsets and their associated rendering pipelines on the performance and comfort score.  This investigation could provide valuable insights into the development of more optimized and user-friendly VR applications across a wider range of hardware.\n",
