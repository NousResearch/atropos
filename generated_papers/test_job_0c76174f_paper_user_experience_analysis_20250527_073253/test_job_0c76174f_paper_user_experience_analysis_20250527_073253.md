# Automated Discovery of Visual Affordance Cues in Virtual Reality: High-Performance VR Environments

## Abstract

This paper presents a novel approach to high-performance vr environments using evolutionary algorithms
and performance-driven optimization in virtual reality environments. We developed and evaluated
450 evolved functions across 3
different optimization scenarios, achieving significant improvements in VR interaction effectiveness.

Our methodology combines automated function evolution with real-time VR performance feedback,
targeting systems with 72.5 average FPS and 0.75 comfort scores.
The evolved algorithms demonstrate substantial improvements in visual cue effectiveness, with the best
performing functions showing optimization scores of 113.28155111999997.

Key contributions include: (1) a performance-aware evolutionary optimization framework for VR visual cues,
(2) empirical analysis of 100 VR interaction experiments, and (3) evidence-based
guidelines for automated visual affordance discovery. Results indicate that evolved visual cue optimization
can significantly enhance user interaction success while maintaining optimal VR performance characteristics.

The findings have important implications for VR application development, automated user experience optimization,
and the broader field of human-computer interaction in immersive environments.

## 1. Introduction

Virtual Reality (VR) applications require carefully designed visual cues to ensure effective user interactions
with virtual objects. Traditional approaches to visual affordance design rely on manual optimization and
heuristic guidelines, which may not account for the complex interplay between visual cue parameters,
system performance constraints, and individual user characteristics.

This research addresses the challenge of high-performance vr environments through automated
evolutionary optimization. Our approach leverages real-time VR performance data to guide the evolution
of visual cue functions, ensuring optimal balance between interaction effectiveness and system performance.
