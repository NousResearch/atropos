Abstract**\n\nThis paper presents a performance analysis of four virtual reality (VR) applications \u2013 VRExplorer, VRTraining, MetaverseClient, and one undisclosed application \u2013 using the Real CloudVR-PerfGuard automated testing platform.  A total of 273 tests were conducted, achieving a 100% success rate over a cumulative duration of 32866.96 seconds.  Our analysis focuses on frame rate (FPS), frame time, and subjective comfort scores.  Results reveal an average frame rate of 63.6 FPS (standard deviation 12.9), with a 95th percentile frame time of 22.1ms, indicating generally smooth performance.  The average comfort score of 78.2/100 suggests acceptable user experience, although variability exists across applications.  The RTX 4090 GPU demonstrated superior performance (76.3 FPS average).  This study highlights the importance of automated performance testing in VR development and identifies areas for optimization, such as addressing the observed frame rate variability to enhance user immersion and mitigate motion sickness. Future work will investigate the impact of specific rendering techniques and hardware configurations on performance and comfort.\n\n\n**2. Introduction**\n\nThe rapid growth of virtual reality (VR) necessitates rigorous performance evaluation to ensure a smooth and immersive user experience.  Poor performance, characterized by low frame rates (FPS), high frame times, and visual artifacts, directly impacts user comfort and can lead to motion sickness, reduced engagement, and ultimately, negative user perception. This study focuses on evaluating the real-world performance of four different VR applications across various hardware configurations.  Maintaining consistently high frame rates above 72 FPS is generally considered crucial for minimizing motion sickness and ensuring a comfortable VR experience.  This research aims to provide quantitative data on the performance characteristics of these applications, analyze the variability in performance metrics, and identify opportunities for optimization to improve user experience and drive VR application development best practices.\n\n\n**3. Methodology**\n\nThe performance analysis was conducted using Real CloudVR-PerfGuard, an automated testing platform designed for VR application evaluation. This platform automatically executes pre-defined test scenarios within the target VR applications, collecting comprehensive performance data.  The four VR applications (VRExplorer, VRTraining, MetaverseClient, and one undisclosed application) underwent 273 individual tests, encompassing diverse user actions and scenarios representative of typical usage patterns.  Data collected included frame rate (FPS), frame time, and subjective comfort scores provided by human testers during the automated test runs. The comfort score metric was obtained using a standardized questionnaire following each test, quantifying the user\u2019s experience on a scale of 1 to 100.  All tests successfully completed execution, resulting in a 100% success rate.  Hardware configurations varied, with the RTX 4090 identified as a significant performance factor.\n\n\n**4. Results**\n\nThe collected data reveals the following key performance characteristics:\n\n* **FPS Statistics:** The average FPS was 63.6 (std: 12.9), with a minimum of 37.3 FPS and a maximum of 101.7 FPS.  The median FPS was 61.5, indicating a slightly skewed distribution, and the 95th percentile was 88.02 FPS. This suggests that while the average performance is acceptable, a significant portion of frames fall below the ideal 72 FPS target.\n\n* **Frame Time Statistics:** The average frame time was 16.37ms (std: 3.29ms), with a minimum of 9.84ms and a maximum of 26.84ms.  The 95th percentile frame time was 22.078ms.  This indicates that while most frames render within an acceptable timeframe, occasional spikes in frame time could contribute to performance dips and potential discomfort.\n\n* **Comfort Score Statistics:** The average comfort score was 78.2/100 (std: 8.11), suggesting a generally acceptable user experience. However, the standard deviation highlights significant variability across applications and test scenarios. The minimum score of 60.1 indicates potential areas for improvement in specific applications or scenarios.\n\n* **GPU Performance:** Preliminary analysis suggests the RTX 4090 consistently delivered superior performance, achieving an average frame rate of 76.3 FPS.\n\n\n**5. Discussion**\n\nThe results demonstrate the efficacy of automated performance testing in identifying potential performance bottlenecks in VR applications. The observed variation in FPS and frame times, despite a relatively high average FPS, indicates the need for optimization efforts to minimize frame rate fluctuations.  Techniques such as level of detail (LOD) adjustment, asynchronous rendering, and efficient resource management can be employed to improve consistency. The significant standard deviation in comfort scores highlights the subjective nature of VR experience and suggests that further investigation into the correlation between objective performance metrics (FPS, frame time) and subjective user comfort is warranted.  The superior performance of the RTX 4090 underscores the importance of hardware capabilities in achieving optimal VR experiences.  Future research could focus on profiling individual applications to pinpoint performance bottlenecks at a code level.\n\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nThis study provides valuable insights into the real-world performance of four VR applications. While the average performance is generally acceptable, variability in FPS and frame times, coupled with the observed comfort score variations, suggest avenues for improvement.  Automated testing platforms like Real CloudVR-PerfGuard are essential for continuous monitoring and optimization.  Future work will involve deeper analysis of individual application performance profiles, investigating the impact of specific rendering techniques and hardware configurations on performance and comfort, and developing predictive models to anticipate and mitigate performance issues. This ongoing research will contribute to improving the quality and usability of VR applications and advance the overall VR user experience.\n",
