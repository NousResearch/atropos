## Real-World VR Performance Analysis: SpatialWorkshop Study

**1. Abstract**

This paper presents a performance analysis of a virtual reality (VR) application, SpatialWorkshop, utilizing automated testing within the Real CloudVR-PerfGuard framework.  The study involved 390 test runs, achieving a 100% success rate over a total duration of approximately 13 hours.  Key performance metrics, including frames per second (FPS), frame time, and subjective comfort scores, were collected and analyzed.  Results indicate an average FPS of 58.8 Â± 11.0, with a 95th percentile frame time of 23.3ms, suggesting a generally smooth VR experience.  The average comfort score of 75.2/100 highlights areas for potential optimization.  This research underscores the importance of robust performance testing in VR development, revealing valuable insights for enhancing user experience and identifying bottlenecks.  Further investigation into GPU-specific performance and the correlation between frame time variability and comfort scores is recommended for future work.

**2. Introduction**

The increasing prevalence of virtual reality (VR) applications necessitates a thorough understanding of performance characteristics to ensure a positive user experience.  Poor performance, manifested as low frame rates (FPS), high frame times, and inconsistent rendering, can lead to motion sickness, visual discomfort, and ultimately, user abandonment.  Maintaining consistent high FPS is crucial for minimizing latency and ensuring a seamless interaction between the user and the virtual environment.  This study focuses on the performance analysis of SpatialWorkshop, a VR application, using a rigorous automated testing methodology to identify potential performance bottlenecks and guide optimization efforts.  The objective is to provide quantitative data and insights for improving the overall quality and usability of VR applications.

**3. Methodology**

Performance testing was conducted using Real CloudVR-PerfGuard, an automated testing framework designed for comprehensive VR performance analysis.  The framework automatically executes the SpatialWorkshop application across a diverse range of hardware configurations (although specific hardware details are not provided in this study beyond the identification of the RTX4090 as a high performer).  A total of 390 tests were performed, yielding a 100% success rate. Data collected included FPS, frame time, and a subjective comfort score, gathered through a built-in comfort assessment mechanism within the application. The duration of the testing period was 46766.15 seconds (approximately 13 hours).  Statistical analysis, including mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, median, and 95th percentile values, were calculated for each metric to provide a comprehensive understanding of performance distribution.

**4. Results**

The performance metrics gathered from the 390 test runs are summarized below:

* **FPS Statistics:** Mean: 58.8 FPS, Standard Deviation: 10.99 FPS, Minimum: 38.6 FPS, Maximum: 93.1 FPS, Median: 57.3 FPS, 95th Percentile: 79.4 FPS.  The relatively high standard deviation suggests a degree of variability in performance across different test runs or potential underlying performance inconsistencies within the application.
* **Frame Time Statistics:** Mean: 17.57 ms, Standard Deviation: 3.14 ms, Minimum: 10.74 ms, Maximum: 25.88 ms, Median: 17.465 ms, 95th Percentile: 23.265 ms.  The 95th percentile frame time is a critical metric, indicating that in 95% of the test runs, the frame time did not exceed 23.3ms.
* **Comfort Score Statistics:** Mean: 75.2/100, Standard Deviation: 7.18, Minimum: 61.2, Maximum: 95.1, Median: 74.4, 95th Percentile: 88.5.  The average comfort score suggests a generally acceptable level of comfort, however, the variability and lower scores indicate potential issues impacting a subset of users.  The RTX4090 GPU exhibited the highest average FPS (71.1 FPS), highlighting its superior performance capabilities for this specific application.

**5. Discussion**

The results indicate that SpatialWorkshop generally performs well, achieving an average FPS above the commonly accepted threshold for comfortable VR experiences (generally considered to be above 60 FPS). However, the standard deviation in FPS and the presence of lower comfort scores highlight areas requiring further investigation and optimization. The relatively high standard deviation in FPS might indicate inconsistent resource utilization, potential frame drops, or sensitivity to varying levels of workload within the application.  Further analysis is needed to pinpoint the source of this variability. The lower comfort scores suggest that certain aspects of the application might be contributing to motion sickness or visual discomfort in a segment of users, potentially linked to frame time inconsistencies or scene complexity.  Optimization strategies could focus on reducing resource-intensive processes, implementing efficient rendering techniques, and adjusting the application's complexity based on hardware capabilities.  A correlation study between frame time variability and comfort scores would further elucidate the impact of performance fluctuations on user experience.

**6. Conclusion**

This study provides valuable insights into the real-world performance of the SpatialWorkshop VR application. While the overall performance is acceptable, the significant standard deviation in FPS and lower comfort scores indicate opportunities for optimization. Future work should focus on identifying the root causes of performance variability and their correlation with user comfort.  Detailed profiling of the application, coupled with targeted optimization efforts, can lead to a more consistent and comfortable VR experience.  Moreover, expanding the hardware diversity in future testing will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the application's performance across a wider range of user systems.  This research underscores the importance of automated performance testing in VR development, enabling developers to proactively address potential performance issues and enhance user satisfaction.
