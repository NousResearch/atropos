## Real-World VR Performance Analysis: SpatialWorkshop Study

**1. Abstract**

This paper presents the results of a performance analysis of a virtual reality (VR) application, "SpatialWorkshop," conducted using the Real CloudVR-PerfGuard automated testing platform.  The study involved 174 test runs, achieving a 100% success rate across a total duration of approximately 5.8 hours.  Performance was assessed using key metrics including frames per second (FPS), frame time, and a subjective comfort score. The average FPS was 59.6 (std: 11.2), with a 95th percentile frame time of 22.3ms, indicating generally smooth performance.  The average comfort score of 75.8/100 suggests acceptable user experience, though opportunities for optimization exist.  Analysis reveals a significant standard deviation in FPS, highlighting potential performance variability across different hardware configurations.  The study identifies the RTX 4090 as the best-performing GPU within the tested dataset (71.8 FPS).  These findings provide valuable insights for VR application developers aiming to improve performance and user experience, particularly focusing on mitigating performance fluctuations and optimizing for a wider range of hardware capabilities. Future work will explore the correlation between specific hardware configurations and performance variations to further refine optimization strategies.

**2. Introduction**

The increasing prevalence of virtual reality (VR) applications necessitates rigorous performance analysis to ensure a positive user experience.  Poor performance, characterized by low frame rates (FPS), high frame times, and visual artifacts, can lead to motion sickness, disorientation, and overall dissatisfaction, significantly impacting user engagement and adoption.  Maintaining a high and consistent FPS is crucial in VR, as even minor frame drops can disrupt the sense of presence and immersion.  This study focuses on the performance characteristics of "SpatialWorkshop," a VR application, utilizing an automated testing framework to collect and analyze a comprehensive dataset for identifying areas for optimization and enhancing the overall user experience.

**3. Methodology**

This study employed Real CloudVR-PerfGuard, an automated testing platform, to conduct performance analysis of SpatialWorkshop.  The platform automatically runs the application across a variety of hardware configurations and collects detailed performance metrics.  A total of 174 test runs were executed, resulting in a 100% success rate.  Data collected included FPS, frame time, and a subjective comfort score (obtained through post-experiment user surveys integrated into the testing platform).  The comfort score is a user-reported metric ranging from 0 to 100, representing the user's perception of comfort and immersion during the VR experience.  Statistical analysis was performed to determine the mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, median, and 95th percentile values for each metric.  This approach provides a comprehensive understanding of both average and extreme performance behaviors.

**4. Results**

The collected performance data reveals the following key findings:

* **FPS Statistics:** The average FPS was 59.6 (std: 11.17), with a minimum of 37.9 FPS and a maximum of 90.6 FPS.  The median FPS was 58.3, and the 95th percentile was 80.84 FPS. This indicates a relatively high average frame rate, but the substantial standard deviation highlights significant performance variability across different hardware or environmental conditions.

* **Frame Time Statistics:**  The average frame time was 17.34ms (std: 3.14ms), with a minimum of 11.04ms and a maximum of 26.36ms.  The median frame time was 17.16ms, and the 95th percentile was 22.32ms.  The 95th percentile value is particularly important, as it represents the upper bound of frame time experienced by 95% of users.

* **Comfort Score Statistics:** The average comfort score was 75.8/100 (std: 7.32), with a minimum of 60.6 and a maximum of 95. The median score was 75.05, and the 95th percentile was 89.4.  This suggests a generally acceptable level of comfort but also indicates room for improvement for a subset of users.

* **Best Performing GPU:**  Analysis of the dataset identified the RTX 4090 as the best-performing GPU, achieving an average FPS of 71.8.

**5. Discussion**

The relatively high average FPS of 59.6 suggests that SpatialWorkshop generally provides a smooth VR experience.  However, the significant standard deviation (11.2 FPS) points towards substantial performance variations across different hardware configurations or potentially within the application itself. This variability necessitates further investigation to identify bottlenecks and optimize performance across a wider spectrum of devices.  The 95th percentile frame time of 22.3ms indicates that while the majority of users experience a smooth experience, a small percentage might encounter noticeable frame drops, potentially leading to discomfort.  The average comfort score of 75.8/100 is acceptable, yet further optimization could significantly enhance user satisfaction.

Opportunities for optimization include profiling the application to identify performance bottlenecks, implementing asynchronous loading techniques for assets, and optimizing rendering pipelines to reduce CPU and GPU load.  Further investigation into the correlation between specific hardware configurations and observed performance variability is crucial for developing targeted optimization strategies.

**6. Conclusion**

This study provides a comprehensive performance analysis of SpatialWorkshop, revealing a generally smooth VR experience with an average FPS of 59.6 and a comfortable user experience reflected by the average comfort score of 75.8. However, significant performance variations highlighted by the substantial standard deviation necessitate further investigation and optimization efforts.  Future work will involve detailed profiling to identify performance bottlenecks, correlating hardware specifications with performance metrics, and implementing targeted optimization strategies to minimize performance fluctuations and improve overall user comfort.  The findings of this study offer valuable insights for VR developers aiming to create high-performing and immersive applications.
