Abstract**\n\nThis paper presents a performance analysis of four real-world Virtual Reality (VR) applications \u2013 SpatialWorkshop, VRTraining, VRExplorer, and one other unnamed application \u2013 using the Real CloudVR-PerfGuard automated testing platform.  A total of 564 tests were conducted, achieving a 100% success rate over a duration of approximately 19 hours.  Performance was evaluated using frame rate (FPS), frame time, and a subjective comfort score.  The results indicate an average frame rate of 63.4 FPS (standard deviation 12.8), a 95th percentile frame time of 22.1ms, and an average comfort score of 78.1/100.  Analysis reveals a considerable variation in performance across applications and highlights the importance of focusing optimization efforts on reducing frame time variance to enhance user experience. The RTX 4090 GPU demonstrated superior performance, achieving an average of 76.8 FPS. These findings offer valuable insights into optimizing VR application performance and improving user comfort, suggesting areas for future research and development.  The observed performance variations emphasize the need for application-specific optimization strategies to ensure smooth and immersive VR experiences.\n\n\n**2. Introduction**\n\nThe increasing prevalence of Virtual Reality (VR) necessitates a thorough understanding of its performance characteristics to ensure a positive user experience.  Poor performance, manifested as low frame rates, high frame time variance, and visual artifacts, can lead to motion sickness, discomfort, and reduced user engagement. This study aims to quantify the real-world performance of four diverse VR applications across a range of hardware configurations using a standardized automated testing methodology.  Maintaining a high and consistent frame rate is crucial for preventing simulator sickness, characterized by symptoms like nausea, disorientation, and eyestrain.  Furthermore, consistent performance directly impacts user immersion and the overall quality of the VR experience.  Understanding performance bottlenecks and identifying optimization strategies is therefore critical for developing high-quality, user-friendly VR applications.\n\n\n**3. Methodology**\n\nThis study employed Real CloudVR-PerfGuard, an automated testing platform, to assess the performance of four different VR applications: SpatialWorkshop, VRTraining, VRExplorer, and one additional undisclosed application.  The platform automatically runs pre-defined scenarios within each application, collecting detailed performance data.  A total of 564 tests were conducted, each comprising a series of predetermined actions within the VR environment.  The platform recorded frame rate (FPS), frame time (in milliseconds), and a subjective comfort score (on a scale of 0-100) for each test.  The comfort score is based on a combination of metrics including frame rate stability, latency, and motion smoothness.  The success rate of all tests was 100%, indicating the robustness of the automated testing process.\n\n\n**4. Results**\n\nThe collected data provides a comprehensive overview of the VR application performance. Key findings include:\n\n* **Frame Rate (FPS):** The mean FPS was 63.4 (std: 12.8), with a minimum of 35.7 FPS and a maximum of 103.5 FPS. The median FPS was 61.7, while the 95th percentile was 88.15 FPS. This indicates that while the average performance is reasonably good, there is a significant variation in performance, with a notable number of instances experiencing sub-optimal frame rates.\n\n* **Frame Time (ms):** The mean frame time was 16.4ms (std: 3.2), with a minimum of 9.66ms and a maximum of 27.99ms. The median was 16.2ms, and the 95th percentile was 22.1ms. This highlights a noticeable variation in frame time, contributing to the observed inconsistencies in frame rate.\n\n* **Comfort Score:** The average comfort score was 78.1/100 (std: 7.99), indicating a generally comfortable experience. However, a minimum score of 58.9 suggests that some users may have experienced discomfort during certain test scenarios.  The 95th percentile score of 93.88 suggests most users found the experience comfortable.\n\n* **GPU Performance:** Preliminary analysis suggests the RTX 4090 GPU exhibited the best performance, averaging 76.8 FPS. Further investigation is needed to establish conclusive correlations between specific GPU models and performance variations.\n\n\n**5. Discussion**\n\nThe results highlight the importance of minimizing frame time variance to improve VR user experience. While the average frame rate is acceptable, the standard deviation of 12.8 FPS and the 95th percentile frame time of 22.1ms indicate significant performance fluctuations that could negatively impact user comfort and lead to simulator sickness.  The relatively high average comfort score despite the FPS variance suggests that factors beyond raw frame rate (e.g., scene complexity, motion smoothness, and latency) contribute significantly to the perceived comfort.  Optimization strategies should focus on reducing these fluctuations, perhaps through techniques such as level-of-detail adjustments, asynchronous rendering, or improved resource management.  Further investigation into the individual application performance characteristics is required to tailor specific optimization approaches.\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nThis study provides valuable insights into the real-world performance of four diverse VR applications using an automated testing methodology.  The average frame rate of 63.4 FPS and average comfort score of 78.1/100 suggest a generally acceptable user experience. However, significant performance fluctuations, as indicated by the standard deviations in FPS and frame time, highlight the need for optimization strategies to ensure consistent and comfortable VR experiences. Future work will involve investigating the performance bottlenecks within individual applications and implementing and evaluating various optimization techniques.  A more detailed analysis of the influence of specific hardware configurations, including different GPU models and CPU specifications, will also be undertaken to refine our understanding of VR performance variability.  Furthermore, correlating specific in-application events with performance drops would provide actionable data for developers.\n",
