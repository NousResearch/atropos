Abstract**\n\nThis paper presents a comparative performance analysis of four Virtual Reality (VR) applications \u2013 SpatialWorkshop, VRTraining, MetaverseClient, and an unnamed fourth application \u2013 using the Real CloudVR-PerfGuard automated testing platform.  A total of 614 tests were conducted, achieving a 100% success rate over a duration of 73,947.25 seconds.  Performance metrics, including frames per second (FPS), frame time, and subjective comfort scores, were collected and statistically analyzed. Results indicate an average FPS of 62.0 \u00b1 13.2, with a 95th percentile frame time of 22.6ms, suggesting generally smooth performance.  The average comfort score of 77.1/100 points towards acceptable user experience, although room for improvement exists.  The study identifies the RTX 4090 as the top-performing GPU, achieving an average of 75.6 FPS.  This research highlights the importance of automated VR performance testing and provides valuable insights into optimizing VR application performance for enhanced user experience and wider adoption. Further analysis focusing on individual application performance characteristics and identifying bottlenecks is recommended for future work.\n\n\n**2. Introduction**\n\nThe rapid advancement of Virtual Reality (VR) technology necessitates rigorous performance evaluation to ensure a positive user experience.  Poor performance, characterized by low frame rates (FPS), high frame times, and motion-to-photon latency, can lead to motion sickness, visual discomfort, and ultimately, user dissatisfaction.  This, in turn, hinders the widespread adoption of VR in various fields, including gaming, training, and collaboration.  This study focuses on evaluating the performance of four diverse VR applications using an automated testing framework to provide a comprehensive comparative analysis and identify opportunities for optimization.  Understanding the performance characteristics of different applications is crucial for developers and hardware manufacturers to optimize their respective products and deliver immersive and engaging VR experiences.\n\n\n**3. Methodology**\n\nThis research employed the Real CloudVR-PerfGuard platform for automated performance testing.  Real CloudVR-PerfGuard facilitates automated execution, data collection, and analysis of VR applications across a variety of hardware configurations.  For this study, 614 tests were performed across the four target applications.  The testing procedure involved automated launching of each application, execution of pre-defined scenarios (specific in-application actions designed to stress the application), and continuous monitoring of performance metrics.  The key metrics collected were:\n\n* **Frames Per Second (FPS):** Measured as the number of frames rendered per second.\n* **Frame Time:** Measured as the time taken to render a single frame (ms).\n* **Comfort Score:** A subjective score, collected through an integrated system within the application, representing user comfort levels based on observed frame rate stability and potential motion sickness indicators. This score is on a scale of 0-100.\n\nThe data was then analyzed using descriptive statistics to determine mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, median, and 95th percentile values for each metric.\n\n\n**4. Results**\n\nThe analysis of the collected data revealed the following key findings:\n\n* **FPS Statistics:** The average FPS across all applications was 62.0 \u00b1 13.2 (mean \u00b1 standard deviation). The minimum FPS observed was 35.5, while the maximum reached 110.7. The median FPS was 59.9, and the 95th percentile was 87.8, indicating that 95% of the frames were rendered within a time frame corresponding to at least 87.8 FPS.\n\n* **Frame Time Statistics:**  The average frame time was 16.8ms \u00b1 3.4ms. The minimum frame time was 9.03ms, and the maximum was 28.18ms. The median frame time was 16.7ms, and the 95th percentile was 22.6ms.\n\n* **Comfort Score Statistics:**  The average comfort score was 77.1 \u00b1 8.1. The scores ranged from a minimum of 58.7 to a maximum of 95.9. The median comfort score was 76.15, and the 95th percentile was 93.67.\n\n* **GPU Performance:**  Anecdotal evidence from the testing platform indicated that the RTX 4090 consistently delivered the highest performance, achieving an average FPS of 75.6.\n\n\n**5. Discussion**\n\nThe results demonstrate a generally acceptable level of VR performance across the tested applications.  The average FPS of 62.0 is sufficient for a smooth experience for most users, supported by a relatively low 95th percentile frame time of 22.6ms. However, the considerable standard deviation in FPS (13.2) highlights the presence of performance fluctuations that could impact user experience.  The average comfort score of 77.1/100 suggests that while most users reported acceptable comfort, a significant portion of the data points to potential areas for improvement. The high standard deviation in comfort scores (8.1) indicates a wide range of user experiences, suggesting the need for more in-depth investigation into the specific factors influencing comfort in each application.  Further investigation into individual application performance characteristics, identifying performance bottlenecks, and optimization strategies tailored to specific applications would be highly beneficial. The superior performance of the RTX 4090 highlights the importance of GPU capabilities in achieving optimal VR performance.\n\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nThis study provides a comprehensive comparative performance analysis of four VR applications using an automated testing platform. The findings highlight the importance of automated testing in ensuring optimal VR performance.  While the average performance is acceptable, the observed standard deviations and variations in comfort scores indicate opportunities for improvement.  Future work should focus on:  (1)  a more detailed breakdown of performance metrics per application; (2) the identification of specific performance bottlenecks within each application; (3) exploration of optimization techniques to mitigate performance fluctuations and improve user comfort; and (4) exploring the correlation between specific in-application events and drops in FPS/comfort scores. By addressing these aspects, the VR industry can strive towards delivering consistently smooth, immersive, and comfortable experiences for all users.\n",
