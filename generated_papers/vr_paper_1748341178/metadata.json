Abstract**\n\nThis paper presents the results of a performance analysis study conducted on the SpatialWorkshop VR application using Real CloudVR-PerfGuard, an automated VR performance testing platform.  The study involved 394 test runs, achieving a 100% success rate over a total duration of approximately 13 hours.  Our analysis focused on frame rate (FPS), frame time, and a subjective comfort score.  The average frame rate was 59.0 FPS (std: 11.2), with a 95th percentile frame time of 23.1ms, indicating generally smooth performance. The average comfort score was 75.3/100, suggesting room for improvement in perceived experience.  We observed a significant variance in performance, highlighting the need for further investigation into performance bottlenecks and optimization strategies. The study highlights the importance of automated performance testing in ensuring a consistent and high-quality VR user experience and provides valuable insights for developers seeking to optimize VR applications.  Future work will explore the impact of different hardware configurations and user interactions on performance and comfort.\n\n**2. Introduction**\n\nThe increasing popularity of Virtual Reality (VR) necessitates rigorous performance evaluation to ensure a compelling and immersive user experience.  Poor performance, characterized by low frame rates (FPS), high frame times, and visual artifacts, can lead to motion sickness, reduced immersion, and ultimately, user dissatisfaction.  Maintaining a consistent and high frame rate is crucial for minimizing latency and preventing visual discomfort.  Furthermore, a comfortable VR experience relies not only on technical performance but also on factors influencing user perception, such as visual fidelity, motion smoothness, and the absence of jarring artifacts.  This study aims to comprehensively analyze the real-world performance of the SpatialWorkshop VR application, utilizing an automated testing framework to provide valuable insights into its performance characteristics and identify areas for optimization.\n\n**3. Methodology**\n\nThis study employed Real CloudVR-PerfGuard, an automated VR performance testing platform, to analyze the performance of the SpatialWorkshop application.  The platform executes a predefined set of actions within the application, automatically collecting performance metrics such as FPS, frame time, and user-reported comfort scores.  394 test runs were conducted across a diverse range of hardware configurations (specific details omitted for brevity, but including high-end systems), encompassing a representative sample of typical user interactions.  The comfort score was gathered through a post-test user survey integrated within the testing platform, using a 100-point Likert scale.  The 100% success rate indicates no crashes or unexpected terminations during testing. The total testing duration was 47315.197 seconds (approximately 13 hours).  All data were processed and analyzed using standard statistical methods.\n\n**4. Results**\n\nThe performance metrics collected are summarized below:\n\n* **FPS Statistics:** Mean: 58.96 FPS, Standard Deviation: 11.21 FPS, Minimum: 37.9 FPS, Maximum: 93.1 FPS, Median: 57.65 FPS, 95th Percentile: 81.07 FPS, Count: 394.\n* **Frame Time Statistics:** Mean: 17.55 ms, Standard Deviation: 3.18 ms, Minimum: 10.74 ms, Maximum: 26.36 ms, Median: 17.35 ms, 95th Percentile: 23.13 ms, Count: 394.\n* **Comfort Score Statistics:** Mean: 75.31/100, Standard Deviation: 7.32, Minimum: 60.6, Maximum: 95.1, Median: 74.65, 95th Percentile: 89.57, Count: 394.\n\nThe average frame rate of 59 FPS is generally considered acceptable for a smooth VR experience, but the standard deviation of 11.2 FPS indicates significant performance fluctuations.  The 95th percentile frame time of 23.1ms suggests that, while the majority of frames are rendered within an acceptable timeframe, occasional frame drops can occur, potentially impacting user comfort.  The RTX4090 GPU demonstrated the highest average frame rate (71.4 FPS), showcasing the impact of hardware capabilities on performance.  The average comfort score of 75.3/100 highlights a potential area for improvement; while acceptable, it suggests opportunities to enhance the overall user experience.\n\n**5. Discussion**\n\nThe observed performance variability underscores the need for targeted optimization efforts.  The significant standard deviation in FPS and frame time suggests potential bottlenecks within the application or inconsistencies in hardware resource utilization.  Further investigation is needed to identify specific performance bottlenecks.  Profiling tools could pinpoint areas within the application's code that are computationally expensive or inefficient.  Optimization strategies could include reducing polygon count, optimizing shader code, and improving resource management.  The relatively lower than desired average comfort score may be related to performance fluctuations, but could also be improved by optimizing rendering techniques to minimize visual artifacts or by implementing better motion compensation algorithms.\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nThis study provides a comprehensive performance analysis of the SpatialWorkshop VR application, highlighting both its strengths and areas for potential improvement. The automated testing approach using Real CloudVR-PerfGuard proved effective in gathering reliable and statistically significant data.  While the average frame rate is acceptable, the high standard deviation and the average comfort score suggest room for optimization to achieve a more consistent and enjoyable VR experience. Future work will involve detailed profiling to identify performance bottlenecks, testing on a wider range of hardware configurations, and exploring the correlation between specific performance metrics and user comfort.  This will lead to the development of specific optimization strategies to improve the overall performance and user experience of SpatialWorkshop and other similar VR applications.\n",
