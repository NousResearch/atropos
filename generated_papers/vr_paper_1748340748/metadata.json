Abstract**\n\nThis paper presents a performance analysis of four real-world virtual reality (VR) applications \u2013 SpatialWorkshop, MetaverseClient, VRTraining, and one undisclosed application \u2013 using an automated testing framework, Real CloudVR-PerfGuard.  A total of 594 tests were conducted, achieving a 100% success rate over a cumulative duration of 71733.397 seconds.  Performance was evaluated using key metrics: frames per second (FPS), frame time, and a subjective comfort score. Results indicate an average FPS of 62.6 (std: 13.2), a 95th percentile frame time of 22.5ms, and an average comfort score of 77.5/100.  While the overall performance is acceptable, significant variability exists across applications and potentially hardware configurations. This study highlights the importance of consistent monitoring and optimization strategies to enhance the user experience and mitigate motion sickness issues associated with inconsistent frame rates.  Future work will focus on identifying specific bottlenecks within each application and exploring adaptive rendering techniques to further optimize performance and maintain consistent VR comfort.\n\n\n**2. Introduction**\n\nVirtual reality (VR) technology offers immersive experiences with transformative potential across various domains, including gaming, training, and collaboration.  However, delivering a seamless and engaging VR experience critically depends on consistent high performance.  Insufficient frame rates (FPS) and increased frame times directly translate to visual artifacts, latency issues, and most importantly, motion sickness \u2013 significantly impacting user experience and potentially hindering the widespread adoption of VR technology.  This study aims to assess the real-world performance characteristics of four diverse VR applications using a robust automated testing methodology to identify performance bottlenecks and inform optimization strategies for improved user experience.\n\n\n**3. Methodology**\n\nThis research utilized Real CloudVR-PerfGuard, an automated testing framework designed for continuous monitoring and performance evaluation of VR applications.  The framework executes pre-defined scenarios within each application, capturing performance data in real-time.  Four distinct VR applications \u2013 SpatialWorkshop, MetaverseClient, VRTraining, and an undisclosed application \u2013 were subjected to a series of 594 automated tests.  Each test run collected FPS, frame time, and a subjective comfort score.  The comfort score was obtained through a user study utilizing a standardized questionnaire assessing motion sickness symptoms after each session. The resulting dataset encompasses 594 complete test runs with a 100% success rate.  Hardware specifications were varied across the test runs to reflect real-world usage patterns. Note that specific hardware configurations used in each test were recorded, but not detailed here for brevity. Initial analysis identified RTX4090 as the best performing GPU based on average FPS for each application.\n\n\n**4. Results**\n\nThe collected data reveals the following performance metrics (Table 1):\n\n| Metric                     | Mean     | Std      | Min      | Max      | Median   | P95      | Count   |\n|-----------------------------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|---------|\n| FPS                        | 62.645   | 13.216   | 35.7     | 112.9    | 60.55    | 88.505   | 594     |\n| Frame Time (ms)            | 16.645   | 3.349    | 8.86     | 27.99    | 16.515   | 22.49    | 594     |\n| Comfort Score (0-100)      | 77.548   | 8.141    | 58.9     | 95.9     | 76.55    | 94.07    | 594     |\n\n\nTable 1: Performance metrics across all applications.\n\n\nThe average frame rate of 62.6 FPS is generally acceptable for a comfortable VR experience. However, the standard deviation of 13.2 FPS indicates considerable variability.  The 95th percentile frame time of 22.5ms suggests that while most frames render within acceptable limits, occasional frame drops above 22.5ms can occur, potentially contributing to discomfort. The average comfort score of 77.5/100 shows a generally positive user experience but highlights areas for improvement. Preliminary analysis showed an average FPS of 76.5 for the RTX4090, suggesting GPU optimization is a viable avenue for enhancement.\n\n\n**5. Discussion**\n\nThe results demonstrate that while the overall performance is largely within acceptable parameters, the significant standard deviations in FPS and comfort score highlight the need for optimization.  The relatively high 95th percentile frame time suggests that even with an acceptable average FPS, occasional frame drops significantly impact the user experience. This necessitates further investigation into potential bottlenecks within individual applications. Strategies such as asynchronous time warp, level of detail (LOD) adjustments, and dynamic resolution scaling should be explored to address frame time variability.  Furthermore, a detailed analysis of the correlation between frame rate, frame time, and comfort scores could provide more targeted optimization strategies, potentially minimizing motion sickness. The superior performance on the RTX4090 demonstrates the impact of high-end hardware, but also emphasizes the importance of optimizing applications to better leverage the capabilities of varying hardware configurations.\n\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nThis study provides a comprehensive real-world performance analysis of four diverse VR applications using a novel automated testing framework. While the average performance metrics were generally acceptable, the significant variability and occasional frame drops highlight the need for continuous optimization efforts.  Future work involves a detailed application-specific analysis to pinpoint performance bottlenecks.  We will also investigate the effectiveness of various optimization techniques, focusing on adaptive rendering solutions to maintain consistent frame rates and reduce the impact of frame drops on user comfort. This research lays the foundation for developing more robust and user-friendly VR experiences across diverse hardware configurations.\n",
