Abstract**\n\nThis paper presents a performance analysis of the MetaverseClient application within a virtual reality (VR) environment, leveraging the Real CloudVR-PerfGuard automated testing platform.  The study involved 205 test runs, achieving a 100% success rate over a total duration of approximately 6.9 hours.  Performance was evaluated using key metrics including frames per second (FPS), frame time, and a subjective comfort score.  Results reveal a mean FPS of 55.8 \u00b1 11.0, with a 95th percentile frame time of 23.7ms, indicating generally smooth performance.  However, the standard deviation in FPS highlights variability, suggesting potential optimization opportunities.  The average comfort score of 73.2/100 points to a mostly positive user experience, but further improvement is possible. This study underscores the importance of automated performance testing in VR development and identifies specific areas for enhancing VR application performance and user experience.  Future work will focus on investigating the impact of specific hardware configurations and identifying bottlenecks within the MetaverseClient application.\n\n\n**2. Introduction**\n\nThe growing adoption of virtual reality (VR) technologies necessitates rigorous performance analysis to ensure smooth and immersive user experiences.  Poor performance, characterized by low frame rates, high latency, and visual artifacts, can lead to motion sickness, reduced engagement, and ultimately, user dissatisfaction.  Maintaining high frame rates (FPS) above a certain threshold (generally considered to be 72-90 FPS for optimal VR experiences) is crucial for minimizing latency and reducing the occurrence of motion-to-photon latency (MTPL).  Furthermore, frame time consistency is paramount to prevent visual disruptions and improve user comfort.   This research investigates the real-world performance of the MetaverseClient application using automated testing, providing valuable insights for developers seeking to optimize VR application performance and user satisfaction.\n\n\n**3. Methodology**\n\nThis study employed the Real CloudVR-PerfGuard automated testing platform to assess the performance of the MetaverseClient application.  Real CloudVR-PerfGuard is a cloud-based solution that allows for automated and repeatable testing of VR applications across various hardware configurations.  For this study, 205 test runs were conducted, encompassing diverse usage scenarios within the MetaverseClient application.  The testing process involved automatically launching the application, executing pre-defined user interactions, and capturing performance data. The success rate was 100%, indicating robust automated testing process.  Performance metrics were collected at regular intervals during each test run.  The key metrics analyzed included:\n\n* **Frames Per Second (FPS):**  A measure of the number of frames rendered per second.\n* **Frame Time:** The inverse of FPS, representing the time taken to render a single frame (in milliseconds).\n* **Comfort Score:** A subjective metric obtained through user feedback during testing, scaled from 0 to 100, representing the perceived comfort level during the VR experience. This data, while subjective, provide valuable context to the objective FPS and Frame Time results.\n\n**4. Results**\n\nThe collected data revealed the following key performance metrics:\n\n* **FPS Statistics:**  Mean = 55.8 FPS, Standard Deviation (std) = 11.0 FPS, Minimum = 35.7 FPS, Maximum = 87.6 FPS, Median = 53.6 FPS, 95th Percentile = 78.2 FPS.\n* **Frame Time Statistics:** Mean = 18.6 ms, std = 3.4 ms, Minimum = 11.4 ms, Maximum = 28.0 ms, Median = 18.7 ms, 95th Percentile = 23.7 ms.\n* **Comfort Score Statistics:** Mean = 73.2/100, std = 7.3/100, Minimum = 58.9/100, Maximum = 93.6/100, Median = 71.9/100, 95th Percentile = 87.8/100.\n\nThe RTX 4090 GPU demonstrated the highest average FPS (68.5 FPS), indicating a correlation between hardware capabilities and application performance.  The relatively high standard deviation in FPS (11.0) indicates significant variability in performance across different test runs, possibly due to variations in scene complexity or background processes. The 95th percentile frame time of 23.7ms suggests that while the average performance is acceptable, occasional frame drops exceeding this threshold might negatively impact the user experience.  The average comfort score of 73.2 indicates a generally positive user experience, but the relatively high standard deviation suggests significant variability in user perception.\n\n**5. Discussion**\n\nThe results indicate acceptable average performance for the MetaverseClient application, however, the significant standard deviation in FPS and the comfort score highlight areas for optimization.  The variability in FPS suggests the presence of performance bottlenecks within the application, which require further investigation.  Profiling tools can identify specific functions or rendering processes consuming excessive resources.  Optimization strategies could include: level-of-detail (LOD) adjustments for scene geometry, optimized shader code, and efficient asset management.  Addressing these bottlenecks will lead to more consistent frame rates and enhance the overall user experience.  The variability in comfort scores might stem from individual user sensitivity to motion sickness, but optimizing performance can mitigate this issue by reducing frame drops and improving visual stability.\n\n**6. Conclusion**\n\nThis study provides a comprehensive performance analysis of the MetaverseClient application using automated VR testing. The average performance is satisfactory, however, the observed variability highlights opportunities for optimization.  Focusing on reducing the standard deviation in FPS and frame times through targeted code optimization and resource management will improve overall performance and user comfort. Future work will involve more detailed performance profiling, analyzing the influence of different hardware configurations, and exploring advanced optimization techniques to further enhance the MetaverseClient experience.  The success of this study emphasizes the importance of automated testing as a crucial component of VR application development lifecycle.\n",
