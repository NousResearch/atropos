```

### Performance Targets (Week 8)
- **Agent count**: 500 simultaneous agents
- **Tick rate**: ≤10ms/simulation step
- **LLM latency**: ≤2s average response time
- **Memory usage**: ≤8GB RAM total
- **Asset generation**: ≤2min per Point-E object

### Success Criteria
1. **500 agents** running simultaneously without crashes
2. **Social emergence**: Observable group behaviors and resource competition
3. **Asset generation**: At least 50 unique 3D objects created and used
4. **Performance**: Stable 10ms tick rate for 30+ minutes continuous operation
5. **Reproducibility**: Identical results with same random seeds

## Next Phase Preview (Weeks 9-16)
- FLAME GPU 2 migration planning
- Vector database integration (Vertex AI Vector Search)
- Advanced social behaviors and economy
- DreamFusion asset refinement pipeline
- Multi-GPU scaling preparation

## Risk Mitigation
- **LLM API limits**: Local model fallback with Ollama
- **Memory leaks**: Regular profiling and garbage collection
- **Asset pipeline bottlenecks**: Async queue with priority system
- **Integration complexity**: Modular architecture with clear interfaces

## Daily Standups
- Progress against daily goals
- Performance metrics review
- Blocker identification and resolution
- Next-day planning and resource allocation
